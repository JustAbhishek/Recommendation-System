0,Testing requirements in toys and games category,"My product is domino sets for adults. I am the exclusive branded seller of these. I have had several ASINs “yanked” and this is because since the products are in the toys and games category, Amazon wants certain test reports which are applicable to toys. However, my products are not toys and so not subject to testing. Amazon’s website says testing is required for toys intended for children 12 and under. Mine are not. I haven’t been able to get Amazon to reason this out or explain it to me. They just keep repeating “get the testing reports.” Can anyone provide guidance?",Amazon Custom

Without any evidence what so ever, a customer filed a complaint that I was selling an item as used when in FACT it is brand new! Now I’m being told to file a POA for something that isn’t even true! And we all understand that this is time consuming, and frankly speaking a waste of my time all while losing potential sales. I’ve sold over 80,000 products on amazon and never had this type of complaint. The FACT that a customer can make a complaint with zero evidence and thus have my listing deactivated is total BS! To make this even more a total load of BS, after filing a POA with detail, photos and invoices, Amazon is asking for us to file a more detailed POA. I’ve read enough forums about this same complaint.

Since returns are auto-authorized with SFP, customers many times return items because they don’t want them any more and/or because they made a mistake when entering the custom information.

Most recent a-z claim, amazon is telling me I must accept return of a $90.00 order even though the buyer entered in the wrong date for her engraving order. Buyer even placed a new order with the same engraving except changed the date. Amazon custom policy clearly says I’m protected from a-z claims and 3rd party sellers do not have to accept returns on accurately created orders but amazon employees don’t seem to abide by the policy. A-z claim says “different from what I ordered”, however, it is exactly the same as buyer ordered, it’s just that buyer entered in the wrong date. Another problem is “voice of the customer” metric. It shows some popular custom products in “very poor” category for things like “defective item” and “wrong item was sent” but this metric is wholly inaccurate because buyers enter in information they did not intend to. Lastly, recently received 2 “used sold as new” complaints from buyers opening return requests stating the product is defective because there is no option for “I entered in incorrect personalization information”. Seems like it’s happening more and more. Does anyone know if amazon has plans to make the site more friendly to custom products sellers?

They would generate a fake tracking number, tell the customer the order has been shipped, get a few fake reviews, then get their disbursement and ride that as long as they could. And when I contacted Amazon they told me to go through a long involved process to report copyright infringement that required me to actually buy one of these items, have it shipped to me, then send pictures of their product next to our product. Amazon was only helping them buy encouraging their sellers to purchase from them. They also said that we should contact the infringing seller to report them and give a cease and desist. I did that but due to Amazon’s policy of limiting contact between sellers, those messages were throttled to about 10 a day. I was getting about 30-40 stores a day listing my designs. I gave up after documenting over 300 violators selling my own designs. And they weren’t even getting creative. They had stores that were just peoples names or just random characters they hit on a keyboard. This looks all too familiar Amazon finally caught on about a month later but by then, the damage was done. My t-shirt business and many others went down. I now only sell maybe 1 of my custom t-shirt designs in a month. I managed to rebuild my business through Amazon custom because having the feed to upload the custom details created a 2nd level of sophistication that these scammers weren’t able to pull off. Now they’ve found another loophole. And it all looks exactly like 2016. This isn’t my first rodeo. I’ve been here. If this is happening to you in Amazon Custom - report it. Shout from the rooftops. Email seller-performance@amazon.com. If your sales are down check into this. It could be that someone is flooding your category with fake stores, maybe even selling your own brands. If anybody has had any luck curtailing this please share. I’ve received little help from Amazon Seller Support.",Amazon Custom
73,Any Way to Escalate A to Z Claim Before Being Forced to Authorzize Return?,"We sold a buyer a diamond engagement ring in the Handmade Section on Amazon. In addition to being handmade, it was custom-sized to the buyer’s ring size specification. Item was shipped to buyer and about 1 week after delivery, we get a Return Request put in through/via Amazon Customer Service (not from buyer initiated process) indicating that the ring was “too bulky”. In other words, buyer’s remorse (more likely, buyer’s girlfriend turned him down and now we’re supposed to eat a moderately expensive handmade ring). We respond indicating that since this was a custom-made-to-order item, it was non-returnable under Amazon’s Custom and Handmade policy. Buyer then opens an A to Z claim with the following rambling (non-sensical) input from Customer Service: Customer comments: The seller do not want to accept the return cause the costumer disputes that size its too big. The product description does not switch sizes and it does not show that its not a returnable item. We respond to A to Z citing the policy, linking the policy and indicating that just because the buyer no longer wants or likes the item, does not change Amazon policy. Returns for this item are at the seller’s discretion. A to Z Claims department says nope, sorry you can eat this $900+ ring. Provide the buyer with return info within 3 days. So, is there anyway to escalate this above the A to Z folks to get someone that will actually enforce (or has read and understood) Amazon’s published policy on Handmade goods BEFORE being forced to provide return info. Once that’s done, we’re screwed. Any suggestions would be appreciated.",Amazon Custom

So, if he sends it back, I am content to send him another one once I get it back, BUT, if he did decides to open a claim against me, am I going to lose the claim since he had sent the original one back and he has tracking to prove it?

83,"Sold customized product, customer not happy with image size the way HE configured it!","I sold two items to a customer that are customizable items, where the customer can upload an image and they can configure the size and placement on the surface of the item themselves prior to submitting the order. In my listing, I show a few different examples where the image may take up most of the surface of the item, and some examples where based on the dimensions of the image, it is placed in an area on the item that does not take up the full surface. My listing clearly states that the image will be placed on the full surface of the item “as image size permits”, but for smaller images it will be placed on the lower surface. Both images that the customer uploaded had dimensions that prevented the full surface from being taken up by the image. The reason is because if I ignored the way the customer configured it himself and made the image larger to fill the full surface area, the left and right sides would have been cropped out. Therefore, in order to maintain the proper proportions of the image, it was sized to include the full image, which did not take up the full surface. The customer even configured it this way before he submitted the order, so not sure how he thought I was supposed to work some kind of magic to make it fill the entire surface without cutting out a good portion from the left and right sides. He submits a return request “wrong item sent” (of course) because he wasn’t happy that the image didn’t take up the full surface, and I politely responded and explained everything that I basically said here. I then ended off by telling him that if he still wishes to return them, he will be responsible for the return shipping and subject to a 50% restocking fee, since the item cannot be resold. This is the first time I have had to deal with a customer wanting to return a customizable item. I was curious if the same return policy still applies, or if a seller is not obligated to accept the return because the item is basically useless to the seller, since it was customized by the customer with his personal images? Also in this case, the customer was aware of the sizing and placement of the image on the surface since he placed it that way himself, and I basically replicated exactly what he did. Therefore, the product was produced to the exact specs that the customer provided. Seems unfair that I should get stuck with this. Just curious to know if I dealt with this correctly, or was there some other option available to my benefit?",Amazon Custom

So please add a function that when they are customizing the item once they click on the add to cart, a preview of item should be shown to customer with a required box to click where they approve the preview/spelling/non copyright etc This will avoid issues with placement, spelling and copyrighted materials that customer upload",Amazon Custom

We are selling invitations, announcements, and wedding stationery which are not a square. Some are 8.5"" x 5.5"" portrait orientation and some are 5.5"" x 8.5"" landscape.

Yet, my listing shows as if there other sellers selling it. There are no other sellers selling it. It’s custom. And, I am the only seller listed. Why this happens I have no idea. I decided I would try some ads to get some sales and history, etc. I spent several hours during research and setting up my ads yesterday for this new product. The ads said there were delivering. However, when I checked back a couple of hours later, I discovered that none of the ads were running because the products are not BUY BOX ELIGIBLE. I understand that when there is a commodity that others are selling the exact same model, etc that this scenario makes sense. But why does this happen with a custom product? The response from support was boilerplate and that I need to lower my price to win the buy box. I have a premium product that is different from low-end competitors. They also told me to use Facebook ads. Which I have done, but they are not effective because they are interruption marketing and not aligned with shoppers. So, I am looking to understand what I am doing wrong here. I have created a great product, optimized my listing and yet Amazon doesn’t want to advertise my product.

Since this 3200x3200 is really large, most of the times the image aligns in the center so we need to scroll down so we can see the info provided by the buyer, or we can just zoom out so we can see how the buyer will want the item to look like.

140,"Brand Registry, Trademarks, & items without GTINS","I have been selling on Amazon custom since it first started, and had been able to register my brand so that I could receive a GTIN exemption which enabled me to list my personalized items that do not have GTINs or UPCs. This week I received an email from Amazon which states: “We will deprecate the prior version of Amazon Brand Registry on May 31, 2018, which may lead to a decreased authority over product listings on Amazon with your brand name and the removal of your ability to list products on Amazon without GTINs, UPCs, or EANs. If you are a seller who enrolled a brand in Amazon Brand Registry prior to May 2017, you must re-enroll your brand in the new version of Amazon Brand Registry to avoid any disruption in service.” However, in order to enroll in the new brand registry, you have to have a registered trademark, which can take up to a year to obtain! I am not sure how this is going to affect my sales of my personalized products in Custom. Does it mean they aren’t going to show up as much, or that I won’t be able to list new items? Do I have to apply for a trademark and enroll in the brand registry in order to keep getting GTIN exemptions? I looked into buying UPCs, but I have a lot of items and the legitimate ones through GS-1 would cost thousands of dollars which is way beyond the means of my small business. So I guess my question is can I still get a GTIN exemption to sell in Custom if I have to wait a year to get a trademark so that I can enroll in the new brand registry? And what will happen to my current listings when they make this change at the end of May? Thanks for any advice!",Amazon Custom
141,Customization Information,"Does anyone include a snippet or screenshot of the Customization Information screen with their order?

I briefly tested Microsoft’s Snipping Tool and it seems to work fine for this purpose. I don’t like that the small thumbnail of the customization image can be shown full size only on hover, so its hard to get a snippet of that one. The other customization image has the white boxes around the fields that can be customized, which is a bit detracting. Is anyone else doing this and have you found it helpful?",Amazon Custom

However, the above statement indicates that third party sellers have the option whether they want to refund the product or not - but because of the auto return authorization, we are not even given the chance to choose whether we want to proceed with the refund. We have no issue offering a refund, in fact we probably would refund most of these orders anyway, we just think something might be wrong here since we are not getting the option to approve or deny. I chatted with support a bit, and I was told that custom item return requests will be auto authorized if the customer selects a reason code that indicates the item was damaged or defective upon arrival. However, we are seeing reason codes like ‘too small’ and ‘no longer needed’ which don’t indicate that anything was wrong with the product upon arrival. Side note: we do have ‘Returnless Refunds’ set up for our account. Could it be that the two are conflicting? And that as long as we have returnless refunds set up, we won’t be given the option to approve or deny requests for refunds on custom items? Any ideas? thanks!",Amazon Custom

186,Racially Hateful Amazon Custom Request - What Do I Do?,"Has anyone received something like this? What did you do? We received an Amazon Custom order from a person requesting we engrave a knife with a name, two swastikas and some text that translates in English to “the white calling”. I contacted Amazon support and requested they cancel the order and block the buyer from leaving feedback. They told me they couldn’t do that, but I should contact the customer and request they cancel the order themselves. The customer did not respond by the end of the business day before the item was set to ship, so we were forced to cancel it to void late shipment. I messaged support again on the same case and the agent said that I should contact support again to have the feedback removed if the buyer left negative feedback. The buyer left negative feedback, saying “Why was my order canceled?” This was after we sent multiple messages to the customer addressing the situation, and also after the customer emailed us on 12/17. She sent us an email asking why her order was canceled, to which we responded with two separate emails letting her know why. I opened another case with support to have the feedback removed, and the request was denied. The agent assisting on the case sent me back the standard copy-and-paste email that all denied requests for feedback removal get. I appealed it and the agent from the leadership team did the same copy and paste response. IMO Amazon has brought us a customer that requested we create a weapon with racially hateful statements and symbols on it. We should certainly be able to decline such a request without fear of repercussion, and negative feedback is certain in situations like this - all sellers know this. I feel like if Amazon does not protect Custom sellers against racially hateful requests like this, then Amazon is almost requesting that we make these products with hateful symbols and text. We have had other requests like this on other marketplace sites and we handle them the same way. We cannot be expected to create products with swastikas on it under threat of negative feedback. That is just as good as Amazon telling us we must do it, because multiple instances of negative feedback means account suspension. Even if we comment on it, our average and search results are still negatively affected. I mean, right?",Amazon Custom

For instance I want to keep my Softball Tie Dye T-Shirt that we sell for $15.99 and create a separate ASIN for the item where it is able to be customized and charge $25.99. I am hesitant to just turn my regular listing into custom because of the price difference and our sales seem to drop what I turn existing SKUS into custom products. I ask this question because I know duplicate listings on Amazon are a sensitive subject.,Amazon Custom
202,Cancelling custom order that contains requests that are offensive,"Hello, We have been selling custom items for several months. We have received a couple of orders that were questionable content, but not offensive. If we get an order that does not comply with the ‘Customization Program Terms and Conditions’, how do we properly cancel the order to ensure it does not negatively affect our ‘order cancellation rate’ ? Also, how do we ensure Amazon is aware the order was canceled due to offensive content? If the seller complains about the order cancellation, Amazon needs to know why the order was canceled. Thank you. Jason",Amazon Custom

Still he is very persistent on asking for a refund and even threatened us for a bad review (I can reply a post and explain that we disclosed that we do not guarantee shipping).

Before SFP, if a customer wanted to return the item, we would usually issue a refund and just say “keep it”. Once we print it with a custom decoration, we can’t resell it of course. But with SFP, Amazon handles all these refund requests for us. They are issuing return labels and we have to pay the postage, even though we don’t want it back. Is it possible to change a setting somewhere in our account? Some kind of “never issue a return label” setting? We’re okay with refunding the order (although it’s not ideal), but it’s a real kick in the pants to also have to pay for return shipping on a personalized t-shirt. Thanks!",Amazon Custom

We have had many orders in the last 2 months and the pricing has worked great until an order we received today. Today we received an order for a 12 way, which should have cost 24.99 + $100, but Amazon only charged the customer $24.99. We checked the listing for mistakes and everything is setup correctly. We even checked the order and it shows the chosen customization should have increased the price by $100 (see attached picture). We have business pricing and quantity discounts enabled. After realizing this is the first business order for this item; the only conclusion we can come up with is that either there was a systems issue or that business pricing is not set up to correct charge the customer the incremental price. A case has been opened, but I fear we will not get a resolution until after the ship by date/time tomorrow. Any help is greatly appreciated!",Amazon Custom

I have been a #18 best seller for a while, and I keep getting shipping errors and bad reviews that are confusing my customers (which have been promised to be removed by the way) Here my problem I’m a custom seller and I am Seller fulfilled prime which is an experimental program. I need direct communication with the buyer if the image uploaded is not suitable. The buyer should have to check a box confirming that they will allow phone calls from the seller if it a custom items image does not comply with the guidelines. In every case where a non-solicitation option is turned on, or the buyer does not respond in time, and I need to talk to the customer it affects my performance. Here is how to fix it: In the customize now widow add a text box for a phone number and a confirmation checkbox to confirm that the customer allows commutation with the seller in case of image correction. The checkbox fixes privacy issues and by provide a number it provide security in that if the image is wrong the buyer will be contacted. My number one phone call ask “what will happen if the image is not right” adding a mandatory phone number fixes this. It also will reduce inaccurate reviews when needed commutation was not provided due to flaws in the system. This will help improve amazons system as a whole. Customer service is part of a review, this will help me to provide quicker and more accurate customer service. I would even be willing to be monitored and recorded to assure amazon of my abilities.

Has anyone considered the fact that Amazon doesn’t care about any one seller in particular and keeps capitalizing and manipulating the power of the position that they’ve acquired in this marketplace! Furthermore, does anyone think that Amazon DOESN’T have accounts set up to respond to our posts in these forums? Of course they do, wouldn’t you if you we’re them (if you had no integrity, morals or ethics)? This is why they do nothing after you’ve proven your innocence and or explained properly why something has negatively affected your metrics and you would like it to be corrected As like the rest of the world, if your not a 1 percenter, YOUR NO ONE to Amazon. You will get moderate help but at the end of it all, you will be ignored. At that point, “Bots” take over and your account and account metrics as well as the majority of your correspondences will be dealt with by the “Bots”. We’re just get left dangling in the wind receiving an I’m sorry, but that’s all I can do or maybe repetitive emails saying they’re still working on your issue. It’s even funnier when you keep getting those “Bot” emails for 2 or even 3 weeks and the issue has been resolved. Unfortunately, Amazon has a huge chunk of the market and even though we’re treated terribly, we still stay. Eventually their open/free marketplace will not be available to the common person as Amazon will have ran us down to a point where we MUST move on, giving them the entire table like they want. Granted that’s a long time away but mark my words, it will happen. I do understand that Amazon is a business and is expected to operate as such (making money) but with that being said, They’re supposed to be “IN BUSINESS WITH US” and that’s definitely not what their actions say to me. On the contrary, I feel as if they do the bare minimum to keep Sellers thinking that Amazon is your partner in this marketplace when truly, they are not. I realize I have some questions in this statement but after reading what I’ve wrote, it feels more like a sad story.

I had a customer place an order and upload a file that doesn’t meet the required specifications that I had listed in the description. I messaged the customer about it and sent him a template for the file and ask that they update it and resend it to me through a message. I still haven’t heard back from the customer and the order is due for shipping tomorrow. I don’t want it to affect my “Late Shipment Rate”. Is there any way to pause or put a hold on the order until the customer sends me the new file?,Amazon Custom

263,Paying too much for return at UPS Store,"Anyone notice The UPS store always use the most expressive shipping for Customer?

264,Amazon sellers site won’t load after making a shipment?,Since amazon updated their shipping section when I create a label the page seems to freeze. Clicking any of the buttons like “return to manage your orders” won’t go anywhere. Even if I exit the site go to goggle and then type amazon sellers and try an log back in it just says processing.

Again we contacted them asking for photos of the damage. and still no response. Then we got a notice from Amazon stating that the customer filed a claim on us. We responded to Amazon with the emails we sent the customer and were told by amazon that we were not liable for the claim. Now we have a bad rating from that customer and our account is at risk.

271,Confirmed delivered denied in A-Z claim!,"No I don’t know about any of you other sellers out there right now but I’m tired of the A-Z claims where the buyer claims he or she never received the item when it’s been clearly marked delivered by the carrier. Here are Amazon’s “rules or guidelines” they go by when there’s an “Items Not Received” A-Z Claim Additional Information about A-to-z Guarantee Claims for Items Not Received Sellers are accountable for resolving A-to-z Guarantee claims for items Not Received and the claims will be processed according to the following policies: Products(s) Shipped without Tracking A seller will be liable for a not received claim if Estimated Delivery Date (EDD) has passed and the order was shipped without tracking information. This policy will apply to all orders, including those shipped by media mail. Product(s) Shipped with Tracking - In Transit If a product is not delivered by the end of the EDD range, and tracking information shows an expected delivery in the near future (and the product was shipped by the promised ship date of two business days from the order date) the claim will not be granted and the buyer will be asked to wait for the product. The seller will not be liable. However, if tracking information does not show expected delivery in a reasonable timeframe, the claim will be granted and the seller will be held liable. This will apply to packages lost in transit as well. Product(s) Shipped with Delivery Confirmation Tracking - Tracking Shows Delivery and Buyer Claims Item Not Received The A-to-z Guarantee team will investigate the dispute. Amazon may contact the buyer to confirm non-receipt. If no receipt is confirmed, the seller may still be held liable for lack of fulfillment - Amazon will not cover service errors, including loss, theft, or postal/shipping issues. Amazon will, however, continue to protect sellers from fraudulent buyers and A-to-z Guarantee abusers. Product(s) Shipped with Signature Confirmation Tracking - Tracking Shows Delivery and Buyer Claims Item Not Received If the name on the signature confirmation matches the buyer, the A-to-z Guarantee team will deny the claim. If signature confirmation does not match the buyer, the A-to-z Guarantee team will deny the claim and ask the buyer to follow-up with the individual that signed for the package. Guarantee claims for packages that are signed for by a freight forwarder or an agent of the buyer (e.g. receptionist, family member) will be denied. However, if an investigation determines that the customer did not receive the order due to a shipping error beyond his or her control, the seller may be held liable. We anticipate that this would be a very rare occurrence Now I don’t know about any of you other sellers but if Amazon won’t cover service errors, including loss, theft, or postal/shipping issues why should the seller if it’s been confirmed delivered by the carrier? I know that we hit every single one of these guidelines and requirements but we still have been getting charged for these types of A-Z Claims and it’s starting to cost us a lot more money and we’re going to have to start adding a percentage to every order it continues to get worse.",Amazon Custom

275,Case I define my casepacks for FBA shipments?,"Hello, I have products prepacked from the factory in a musical run case. For example: a casepack contains 6 units in 4 sizes (4 skus): 1S, 2M, 2L, 1XL. Can I ship my cases this way to Amazon FBA? Or can I only ship casepacks that contain the same SKU (ie. case contains all size S)? When I try to create my shipping plan with the casepack option, it looks like Amazon defines a casepack as units with the same SKU. There’s no option for me to define my casepack to have 1 case = 1S, 2M, 2L, 1XL. And when I tried the individual option - Amazon doesn’t allow me to allocate my units to a defined case. Amazon does the unit allocation which can result in me having to break my original casepack and repack to ship to multiple DCs. For example: Amazon assigns 1S to ship to a DC, 1M and 1L to ship to another DC, 1M to ship to another DC, 1L and 1XL to another DC. Which means I would need to have my warehouse take 1 case and repack it into 4 new cases. Doing this would be too costly due to the pick and pack labor and the cost of the additional cartons needed to repack into. Does anyone have any experience with this kind of scenario? Or is the only solution to have the factory ship cases that contain only 1 SKU inside.

284,UPC Policy Change by Amazon,"I have just become aware of the UPC policy change (ok, it’s a part-time job). I’m currently selling several successful products using Amazon Custom. I searched on the forum for questions related to mine but I couldn’t find anything. My questions: If I purchase BRANDX branded champagne flutes from BRANDX and want to sell them Engraved in an Amazon product listing using the Amazon Custom program, do I add the listing using my own GS1 purchased company prefix for UPC code or do I use BRANDX’s UPC code? My perception was that I can’t use the Custom feature for a listing I don’t own (e.g. BRANDX’s listing). Am I allowed to use the BRANDX brand in the product name if I use my own GS1 company prefix for the UPC? Just looking for clarification so that I don’t violate policy.

288,Why is Amazon custom the only forums I have permission to view / post in an,"I will get to my actual question in a second but asking it has brought me to another question which supersedes it, and that would be why I only have permission to view or post in this Amazon custom forum when nothing I do is custom? Not only is this the only forum I can post in its the only forum I can see the questions / answers on. The whole help section in my seller central all leads me to pages that say: Seller Forums Amazon Seller Forums Sorry, you do not have permission to view this content. and then when I start directly from the forums home page all it will let me access is the Amazon custom forums. My original question: Why is 99% of the items I am trying to list market as collectible and off limits for me to sell in? Before you answer keep in mind nothing I am selling would be considered collectible by anyone. For example I have approx 50 - 75 wifi cards that came out of laptops I have worked on over the past couple month, (this also goes for the keyboards, ram,… well everything… about 1 out of 10 things are not marked as collectible and therefore lets me post. Even more perplexing is that there is no rhyme or reason to the grouping, the keyboard of one computer might be collectible but the HDD and ram covers are not collectible, or the Bluetooth and screen of one is restricted but ram and screen cover isnt. But I can sell the whole computer put together because thats not restricted. If all the parts and pieces are collectible wouldnt the computer as a whole also be considered collectible? On that same note how / why is it possible for SOOOO many sellers to slap a sticker with there company name and call a product their own then threaten to sue me for posting in their personal space… There are not 50 people making 2gb DDR2 ram (well maybe there are 50 but they are not the ones listed here which include Computer memory solutions or Offtek Memory or A-Tech Components or one of my favorites: parts-quick.) No offense to any of the above mentioned sellers if you stumble upon this thread. So if I pull some ddr2 ram out of a tough book (or any other part) I am restricted from selling it by its real name because for some reason 2 year old ram has become a collectors item, then I get lawsuit threats from every storefront who has a label maker. Can I slap a label on a new Apple mac book laptop and sell it as a “Maxbook”? Isn’t that the same thing as peeling off the labels of Panasonic batteries or Kingston ram?

This has happened more than once and has been fix a few times. The error started with a lead time error: my branding irons take at least 3 days to make, so my lead time was set at 9 days to give me time for a lot of orders anytime I updated my quantity the lead time was set to 1 day and I’d get 2-3 next day orders which is not possible. This ruins my account health and turns my products “customize now” button gray. There are 2 cases open and technicians are fixing coding in my account again. My shipping is not updating after being sent. I have multiple packages shipped with labels printed on amazon that has been lost or delayed in with no updates. I am in communication various post office and the customers who are waiting and asking about shipping. Some package made it to the customer without any tracking change until the package was delivered. I am getting worried about the last few packages showing no signs of even being picked up. One customer sent this image of their tracking which is the only hint I have to what’s going on. I have remade as many of stamps I can afford and continuing to do so as other sources of money come in. What is going on? Is it just me with this issue?

Some are; Increase the limit of text print areas (currently 5). Due to the nature of our products and the way Amazon Custom handles font sizes, we need roughly 8 to 10 to work with the majority of our products. Allow for multiple photo uploads on a single surface. We offer photo collages which only work with this. Allow for font selection and font color PER text block. Our designs typically have multiple font styles within them and due to the background, the font color needs to change in areas to make sure the text is visible. Allow for both photo AND text blocks. Currently its photo OR text blocks. I’m aware the photo option allows for a single custom positionable text block.

One of my listings was deactivated the other day due to a high amount of negative reviews. I checked it out, and 100% of the complaints were “wrong item sent.”After doing some more digging, I saw that a few other items were getting mixed up, too. Customers are being sent other items from my inventory. It all stems from the same FBA shipment. This is not a labeling error on my part - all items come with manufacturer label. (I do commingle, I understand I should change this - could that be the issue here? They are still items from my own inventory that are being sent, just the wrong item.) Not only do they have manufacturer barcodes, but these particular items are prepped and sent to Amazon by me, and I inspect each item. They were also all checked in and received properly.The only thing I can think is that this is a fulfillment issue. I find it highly unlikely (but I guess not impossible) that the distributor sent mislabeled items and that it somehow made it past me during prep. Still, should I recall these items for inspection and then resend them for fulfillment?

Around last Wednesday I started to notice my sales went from the normal 5-10 units a day to 0. On the first day I chalked it off as a fluke. On day 2 I decided to dig a bit deeper. It turns out Amazon INCORRECTLY flagged all 430 units I had in their warehouses as expired. This is simply NOT POSSIBLE given this inventory was only manufactured several months ago and has a 2 year shelf life. OCTOBER 2021 expiration date to be exact.Immediately I opened a case. It took 3 attempts to even get through to someone who spoke fluent english because the first 2 attempts were routed to who knows what country to people who not only were unable to communicate with me verbally but they must have been talking from dial up modems because there phone connection was terrible.On the 3rd attempt I was routed to someone here in the US. The person on the phone said that the system applying an “incorrect expiration” are a known issue on the platform and they were going to put an immediate request to have the units manually inspected for the correct expiration dates and once verified, they would be put back into my active inventory. This was on Friday of last week.Today I get a message from the open case that was created from the inbound call that there is nothing I can do to get the inventory put back to active since there is already a open disposal order.I log into my dashboard and I see that amazon has ALREADY DISPOSED OF 280 perfectly good sellable units of my inventory WITHOUT MY CONSENT OR ANY NOTIFICATION whatsoever.

The buyer can remove the feedback if they choose to.To contact the buyer, go to the Orders tab in your Seller Account and select Manage Orders.

To do this, go to the Reports heading in your Seller Account and click “Manage your Ratings and Feedback.” From there you can look up the feedback and respond.I responded one more time reiterating that this was an FBA order and in their reply it states why the feedback should be removed, to which Amazon responded:We have reviewed our prior decision and determined that this feedback does not violate ourpolicies. This is our final decision regarding the feedback for this order.The best way to deal with negative feedback is to resolve any transaction issues with thebuyer. The buyer could then remove the feedback if they feel it is appropriate.Under Feedback Manager, you can also post a public reply under a specific feedback.

They are the exact same size and weight. The only difference is the artwork on the items.I am very confused because:2 of the 6 are currently at the “Small standard size” $2.50 FBA fee.and 4 of the 6 are currently at the “Large standard size” $3.31 FBA fee.Officially, they are large standard size at: 5.6oz & 11""x7""x0.88"" (at least according to my calculations which honestly might be wrong… I eye balled it using a ruler I did not use calipers… It very well may be .75"" height, however even then the thin plastic packaging would push this closer to 1"")However, two of them somehow are under the small standard size FBA fee. - And my payments per order are showing this to be in fact accurate.Oddly enough as well, when I went to run an advertisement campaign on these active listings, the 4 that are in the large standard size category show up as suspended, the 2 small standard sized ones do not, which means they are actively running “pay per click” advertisements. (They are decorative metal trays, main usage is for rolling tobacco - So they technically fall under “adult products”)Now the question,Should I just count my blessings and let them run as they are currently? I mean… Amazon did make this decision of their own accord. I did input all my data on my listing accurately; according to my calculations anyways.OrShould I step up to the plate and tell Amazon they may have made an error, risk losing advertising ability, and pay a larger FBA fee?Anybody have a similar issue?

520,FBA broke my item and won’t reimburse me,"I sold a valuable console through FBA, (worth $500) and got an email for return on the console as (unwanted item) 2 weeks later. Ok, fine whatever, some people are spending too much money and have to return things, no big deal.Anyways, I created a removal order, and after about a month of waiting I received the item today in a huge oversized box with ONE piece of paper and about an oz worth of bubblewrap, NOT HOW I SENT IT TO FBA AT ALL.The sides of the item are completely damaged, and I’m not even sure if it works (haven’t tested it yet) but just the physical damage of it devalues the system by about $150.After calming down, I called fba, sent in pictures, the whole process and was told it’s ineligible for reimbursement because it was “customer damaged”. (Even though the reason for return was unwanted item)Even if let’s say, by some miracle it wasn’t damaged by being put in a huge box, but the costumer got angry and bashed in the sides, why do I have to pay outta my pocket?

530,"Account Deactivated - Amazon Disposed of almost 10,000 units without notice. How can we get reimbursed?","Hello,Any help is greatly appreciated so thank you in advance.We’re a relatively new seller on Amazon (started March 2019). We sell 100% of our inventory FBA. We sell mostly shoes and some clothing (all in new condition). All of our shoes are sourced directly from the manufacturer/brand owner. They provided us with invoices and authorization letters to sell their products on Amazon and advised us to jump on their existing listings that their other sellers were on (good ratings, better exposure). This means we cannot edit or modify these listings.Starting around October 2019, we started to get a few “quality complaints” about some of our shoes. We looked into it and viewed the customer comments they provided us as “proof”. Those comments were normal sizing comments such as “too large” etc. It is completely normal for a customer to buy more than one size and return the pair that did not work out as they could be between sizes. Clothing and shoes are very subjective. You can be a size 8 in one brand and 7.5 in another. Amazon customers are also serial-returners. But, Amazon took this as if there is something wrong with the shoe itself.Additionally, we received “used sold as new” complaints which is extremely hard to believe. We source our shoes directly from the manufacturer and our team can guarantee they are sent brand new as we inspect them prior to shipping. We believe FBA employees might be sending returns as new to customers by mistake. There’s no way to prove this of course and Amazon would never admit fault in this.Before anyone asks, we did not receive any “inauthentic” complaints. We understand that Amazon takes that extremely seriously and would never risk our account with fake goods.So, from October 2019 through January 2020, we receive the few complaints that we mentioned but we were not shut down. Only some listings were closed down and we made removal orders for these individual ASINs. They were not re-listed. From January 2020, it all goes downhill. We’ve summarized it in a timeline below:January 13 - Received Account Suspension notice from Amazon due to quality issues. In the message, they put specific ASINs with issues. Half of them we haven’t sold in 6+ months. They want a POA to address this. They mention editing the listing descriptions (which we can’t do because they are not our listing, it’s the brand’s listing).January 14 - sent POA to Amazon with official invoices and authorization letter from the manufacturer/brand owner.January 15 - Amazon replies to POA stating “insufficient information” and the request an updated POA. We send an updated POA that same day. We don’t even bother defending ourselves anymore. We knew it was better to just admit fault and try to tell Amazon how we will prevent further issues.January 29 - Our POA wasn’t accepted. We receive an Account Deactivation Notice from Amazon.February 3 - We send a Deactivation Appeal with a new POAFebruary 4 – March 22: We go back and forth with Amazon submitting updated POA’s and receiving “insufficient information” replies from Amazon. In total, at the time of writing this, we sent 12 unsuccessful appeals/updated POA’s to Amazon.February 7 - Deleted all products and listings from account as part of an updated POA.March 13 - We start to get worried and start initiating FBA removal orders on inventory that is more expensive or that we have a large quantity of. We get back most of the merchandise from the March 13th removal orders around March 30, but it’s worth noting that a removal order made on March 13 containing 40 more expensive items were never shipped to us as of 5/13/2020. Only the cheaper items that had a large quantity.March 20 - Stay at home orders are issued for NY due to COVID 19.March 22 - Amazon sends message stating we have not provided enough information to reactivate our account and that they may not reply to any further messages from us . The kiss of death.March 24 - Amazon forum notice letting all sellers know that they are temporarily stopping removal orders until further notice due to COVID-19 in order to prioritize shipping and receiving essential items. We thought that included us as well.April 3 - Amazon disposes of almost 10,000 units of our inventory WITHOUT notice. No one on our team is made aware of this. There’s no messages in seller performance notifications or in our email (spam too) which we try to check daily.April 15 - Receive notice from Amazon telling us to remove all inventory by May 14, 2020. or they will dispose of the inventory themselves. At that time, we were still unaware of the huge disposal order they had done on April 3. It is May 13, 2020 at the time of writing this timeline.4.15.2020 Amazon tells us to remove inventory by 5.14.2020.PNG1549×639 56.2 KBApril 16 - Amazon sends another notice to remove inventory but they changed the end date to May 16, 2020 .4.16.2020 Amazon sends second email telling us to remove inventory by 5.16.2020.PNG1613×775 65.3 KBApril 17 - Sent another appeal to Amazon to reactivate account.April 18 - Sent Jeff escalation appealApril 28 - Sent final Jeff escalation appealMay 12 - We realized there were disposal orders of almost 10,000 units done on April 3, 2020 after trying to make more removal orders. We contacted Amazon immediately to stop/cancel these orders. Or, if they were already complete, we wanted to be reimbursed since we received no notice of the disposals. We could not open any cases with Amazon as they would “only answer questions regarding account health”.So, we decided to call instead. After hours on the phone, we finally reach an Amazon rep who seems like he could help. We spoke to him on the phone and opened a case with him. He says the units were disposed of without notice due to unsuccessful appeals to reactivate our account and “due to several product quality complaints which caused products to be flagged as quality and safety concerns at the fulfillment centers with also no successful appeals to reinstate the listings, units got disposed pursuant to section 3 of the agreement in action with section F-7.2”.That’s absolutely ridiculous. Why would shoes and clothing would be flagged as a “quality and safety concern” in the first place? These are NOT hazardous goods.It’s also worth noting that the rep on the phone stated that even if we had made removal orders in advance for all these items, those orders would have be cancelled because of the so-called safety-concerns and the inventory would be disposed of at their discretion. What???As of today, we are unable to reach anyone at Amazon or open any cases with them regarding these disposal orders or any reimbursements. They will only speak to us regarding our “account health” if they even reply.At this point, we don’t care if we get reactivated or not. We’re tired of fighting for that. We just want our items back or a reimbursement for the disposed units. Like we said, they provided only notices to remove inventory by May 14/May 16. It’s only May 13. And they sent those notices on April 15/16 knowing full well they disposed of all our inventory left on April 3!Can anyone provide insight or advice of how to get reimbursed for these items?Thank you!",Fulfillment By Amazon

That being said, please hear me out…For approximately 2 years leading up to September of 2018, nearly every one of my shipments when to ONT8, which is in Moreno Valley, Los Angeles area.  We were shipping FROM a warehouse in Van Nuys, also Los Angeles area.  Then, I happened to send in a shipment from Northern California instead of the Southern California warehouse.  For that shipment SMF3 was chosen (Stockton, more northern in CA, made sense).  Well ever since, SMF3 is now “stuck” no matter where in the COUNTRY I choose as my ship from address.I have just tried creating new shipments from fictional new addresses.  First right next door to the ONT8 fulfillment center where all of my shipments used to go when shipped from Van Nuys, CA.  Then San Diego, then New York.  In all cases, Stockton is chosen as the fulfillment center.  This is the case whether I have Distributed set or Inventory Placement set.Worth mentioning I guess that my business is located in that Northern California location I shipped from… that is my business address.  On the theory that they are calculating based on that address instead of what I’m putting in as the ship from…I’m just worried about changing my business address for experimentation purposes lest they think something shady is going on.Hoping some of you might have come across something like this and could help me figure this out.",Fulfillment By Amazon
543,How much weight do you give Amazon’s ‘Restock Inventory’ suggestions?,"Curious to know how much attention others pay to the ‘Restock Inventory’ suggestions that show up on the Seller Central homepage and on the ‘Restock Inventory’ tab under ‘Inventory Planning.’When Amazon first rolled out the feature, I was skeptical as a lot of the suggestions seemed off (usually too much inventory relative to previous sales). I hoped that the quality of the suggestions would improve as Amazon refined the tool, and so lately I decided to actually fill out some of the lead time information and give it a shot. (At least look at their suggestions and use that as a starting point.)The first suggestion the tool made was to send in a certain number of units for a particular product. I only had about half the number of units the tool suggested handy, so I sent those in, which was going to take me to just over a 3 month supply. (A little more than I usually send, but not unreasonable.)As soon as the shipment went out, an error message appeared beside that product on the ‘Restock Inventory’ tab.“Very high inventory level! Inventory levels in this range can negatively affect your IPI score and your inventory investment returns.”Despite the error message, that product is still showing up #1 on the ‘Restock Inventory’ list and Amazon apparently wants me to send 210 more units today.Obviously not going to do that, but the mixed messages aren’t giving me great confidence in the tool’s other suggestions…Does anyone use the ‘Restock Inventory’ tool?

There are a set of criteria listed on the Shopify website in order to accomplish this, but the guidelines are actually very confusing and sometimes contradictory. Does any here have experience setting this up? My specific questions are:I want the shipping fee NOT to be exactly equal to the amazon fee, rather I want to charge the customers $0 if the checkout is over $50, and $3 less. But i’m not sure if you can set this up without the system/integration with amazon bugging.One of the criteria is to set the shipping price based on weight of the product, so in order to get the clean shipping fees I want ($3 or $0) I need to make up fake weights on shopify. Will it bug the FBA system if the weights listed on Shopify are different than Amazon?Lastly, I know there are apps to simplify this process. Anyone have experience usingAmazon FBA Shipping: ByteStand App and know whether it is necessary",Fulfillment By Amazon
570,"Customer Service Q- FBA item passed return window, customer asking for return",I’m a first-year FBA seller. I had a customer reach out asking to return a large amount of items that are passed the return window. It was an order of 8 sets so I really don’t want to return these. I’ve had other folks reach out and refunded their items without question…but I don’t really want to refund 8 items that aren’t re-sellable. Customer claims reason they want to return them is that they purchased the items for an event that was then cancelled due to Covid-19. They are now passed the Amazon return window and are asking me to extend it. This is an FBA item.Anyone have a recommendation for a polite response that doesn’t end up with me being a doormat  because they overstepped their return window?

One package, only 1/15 items was missing (some good news I guess?).

That’r right, I supposedly sent two empty boxes…I quadruple count my packages before shipping, I take photos of everything, I take a photo of the scale at UPS. What else am I supposed to do?I call Amazon and I get the same robotic answers. “Sir, the FBA warehouse does not have inbound calls.” or answers that do not address my concern.There’s literally nothing I can do to ensure my inventory gets counted properly.

580,How Do I Stop Amazon From Shipping My Items in Merely their Manufacturer’s Packaging?,"I sell a small product that comes in a very thin and flimsy manufacturer’s box. This box is enough to protect the item, but it is not enough to ship the item in. I have no control over the box that the manufacturer uses.Several customers have complained that their items have been horrendously damaged due to the item being only shipped in the manufacturer’s box. They write this on my seller feedback page.However, I have contacted Amazon twice, and each time they tell me that no customers have chosen for their “customer return reason” the option “product damaged.” However, I do have many customers who have chosen “Product damaged or defective prior to shipping.” In my mind though these are the same thing…how would a customer even know if the item was damaged prior to shipping if the item is shipped without a box? Its irrational.However, seller support tells me that only the “product damaged” reason will allow them to change the FBA packaging to a FBA box instead of simply slapping a label on the manufacturer’s box.The problem is that I looked at the return reasons offered for buyers on my own buyer account. There is no option for “product damaged.” There are only options for “shipping box and item damaged” or “shipping box damaged but item ok.” These reasons don’t correspond with the “customer return reasons” found on my FBA returns page.So, I am at a lost of what to do. Furthermore, Amazon has now deactivated my listing and left my FBA items stranded because they are saying that too many customers are getting damaged items. However, this is their fault because they won’t ship it in a box.How do I convince them to stop shipping in the manufacturer’s box and to ship using a real box.Thank you for any thoughts in advance.All the best",Fulfillment By Amazon

582,Message from Compliance regarding cover tint of used book,"This is a new one for us. We received an e-mail from “Compliance and Exception Management” (tier2-na-escalation@amazon.com) regarding product images of one of our used books. This department sounds high tier, so we figure the issue is worth addressing. Despite a vague initial e-mail, we’ve since narrowed the problem down to a matter of an off-colored book cover.We understand that our customers deserve the proper edition and content they are expecting. We also understand that counterfeit problems are real. We’ve caught a few ourselves. Usually these are modern, valuable, textbooks or popular professional references that bad actors can print in volume, rather than an obscure niche text, the likes of which we submitted to FBA. The correspondence makes no mention of counterfeit worries, but that is the only problem we can imagine that the FC is trying to address.We do not actually believe there to be a variance in cover tint here (rather an issue of improper contrast in a poor quality “main item” photo submitted for this ASIN by another merchant), but this does conjure up other potential issues. While changes in edition, cover art, and content may warrant a new ASIN, it is simply not practical that every minor change gets a new ASIN (We’re imagining cover price changes, minor grammatical errors, and yes, natural variances in printing tone). When the ISBN remains the same, these minor changes need not clutter up Amazon’s catalog.There is another issue regarding main item photos. Many, if not most, main item photos are not in compliance with Amazon’s formatting policies. It is not prudent for us to address these instances ourselves for one-off sales, especially considering that photo submission via Amazon is time consuming and our higher quality photos may not even be accepted by support/AI. Furthermore, item photos are ever-changing. Other sellers may choose to submit their own poor quality or inaccurate photos and often the main photo is updated accordingly. Other times, Amazon’s own AI or support choose to change/merge ASINs and photos. We try to address these potential future discrepancies by being over-meticulous with our item descriptions and maintaining near 100% feedback.We are well aware that this is Amazon’s sandbox and that Amazon, their FCs, and support are in “the right” to decide what flies in their marketplace (to their or our peril…well, most likely ours). We also understand that we don’t deserve any special treatment as a 3rd Party used book merchant.We are merely asking for feedback and thoughts from the community (and perhaps we wanted to vent a little). It appears the issue is going to be resolved acceptably, but it remains a bizarre occurrence. We hope that we responded appropriately. Anyone else had similar correspondence? Are there further steps we can / should take?Following is our exchange with support to-date, including the FCs photos and ASIN photo:BlockquoteJun 01, 2020 01:00 PMGreetings from Amazon,Thank you for your prompt reply and for your understanding on this matter.We will request the FC staff to set your item as Unfulfillable so you can place a removal order for it from your Seller Central account, and this way have the item returned to you.If you require assistance from Selling Partner Support placing a removal order, you may use the link below to contact them:http://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/contact-us/contact-amazon-form.html//At the bottom of the page, you will see the option “Need More Help” and click on the “Get Support” button.

I have had many issues with stock missing & it taking months to get reimbursed for those missing items. Which makes sense if they are selling my inventory under another seller name at a lower price than I am listing at.Any remedies for this.",Fulfillment By Amazon

723,FNSKU Labels and Prep Centers (GTIN Exempt),"Hello everyone,I was trying to get an answer to my question from Amazon support, but they keep sending me their general guidance bullets without answering the question. So I’m here.I’m currently selling FBM and was thinking about going FBA. This requires me to send my inventory to the FBA center. When trying to create a shipment to an FBA fulfillment center, I selected “Who preps” as Amazon, and “Who labels” as Amazon too. But further in the process I was told that I had to affix the FNSKU labels to my products myself – the products are not eligible for Amazon Labeling Service even for a fee, because I do not have any scannable or readable manufacturer’s code on the product (any sort of, none). I am the manufacturer and the only seller of my product, I applied for and was granted the GTIN exemption. My problem (apart from the fact that I will have to process 900+ units one by one) is that the product is rather small and the packaging both by design and shape does not allow for affixing the FNSKU labels on it the way Amazon wants (it is a small cardboard tube 5 inches tall and 5 inches in diameter, all the surface is used for product information and branding). The only side where the FNSKU label could theoretically be affixed to, is the bottom. But here is another problem – the FNSKU label size is larger than the bottom part of the tube! I asked the Amazon support if I could downscale the FNSKU label to fit the bottom and if the bottom was the part of the packaging where I could affix it. They could not provide me with any clear answer as if they were not reading the message (I even enclosed the photo of my product and the label so that they could see that the label would not fit).I would be very grateful if someone could answer these questions for me:can I affix the FNSKU label to the bottom of my product packaging instead of any other side?can I downscale the FNSKU label a bit to fit the area it will be affixed to?is there any reliable prep center in Minnesota (preferably) to handle all the labeling (currently my products are packed in what is probably known as “master cartons” – a cardboard box where the tubes are sitting in several rows with bubble wrap added to avoid damage, so effectively it is about opening each of those master cartons, taking all of the content out (one by one), labeling each of the tubes, and packing them all back into those master cartons – can’t even imagine how much this could cost me!).Any suggestion would be highly appreciated.Thank you.",Fulfillment By Amazon

732,Issues with restricted product policy violations and the never-ending headaches to go along with it,"I have a few questions, any help would be appreciated.I purchased a new product through my supplier. While waiting for it to arrive to our business, the listing disappeared from Amazon.I opened a case to find out why and they said it was because it was an unregistered pesticide. They told me I had to list the item and make the appropriate changes to the detail page to have it reinstated.I listed it in an attempt to add any missing details possible (even though it isn’t an actual pesticide, just a trap that lures insects to it). Low and behold, Amazon slaps me with a restricted product policy violation on it, AFTER THEY TOLD ME TO ADD IT TO MY INVENTORY IN ORDER TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE LISTING.What can I do to resolve this? Amazon still has not reinstated the listing and just keeps replying with the we need more time email.I had multiple restricted policy violations on a bunch of different quantities of Reactine. Someone removed the DIN# from all of them. So I updated the DIN for all of them and Amazon approved them all except one.They continually sent me the same email about needing more time until today. They finally reinstated the listing but I’m still stuck with the violation. On top of that, the items I had in FBA are still stuck in stranded and I’m not able to get them to go into my active inventory.EDIT: the stranded inventory has finally went into active. Still need help with the policy violation though.Any ideas on how to solve this?I had a product authenticity customer complaint received on January 21(didn’t show on my account until February 6th). I know it’s an error as I had/have no performance notifications for it. Also, I’ve read a few threads on here where people had the same issue and when it was finally figured out, Amazon admitted it was a technical error.Anyways, I appealed it immediately and have been stuck in transferred status since. I do not want to message Amazon again as I know I’ll get sent to the back of the line.What course of action can I take here?Sorry about the long post.

I had carefully selected a Prime product that would “deliver by Wednesday.” Today, I went to finalize my order and found out that now it will deliver by April 21st.So I got suspicious, and I started looking at our company’s repertoire of FBA products that aren’t in the select 4 categories.In toy, only 1 out of 15 products still has the Prime badge, and the rest won’t deliver for a month.Home fared a little better with about 20% still rating a Prime badge. They all politely say free shipping to Prime members … but no prime badge and you’ll get it 1 month from now if you are a Prime member and by April 30th if you are non-Prime.No announcement of this either to the sellers or the public.Now if Amazon had a) made an announcement and b) informed us that they are not charging us monthly storage fees since they have product they are keeping they won’t ship and c) that they also inform us they will reduce our pick and pack fees since customers are no longer getting expedited shipping, … then I wouldn’t be so disgusted.Note that among all these products are products that people genuinely need like I need this cable to keep doing my job and therefore support myself.So I’m off braving the big bad world to look for my VGA cable at Walmart. We aren’t under full stay at home order here in KY yet, just no groups, social distancing, etc. so this is do-able but risky for me, but for many of you, you just lost your last safe option to get some necessary items for a month … that just don’t happen to be in grocery/pet/health/BISS categories.Becky in KY",Fulfillment By Amazon

745,SFP losing buy box to FBA despite 5 week FBA shipping delay,"Just started this case with Amazon, any other sellers seeing this?…Regarding the extended delivery times for non-essential items, I have noticed that several offers we have currently enrolled in SFP are not getting into the buy box when going up against equal priced FBA offers, even though we are able to deliver the units within the 2 day SFP shipping window and FBA sellers have delivery dates that are weeks out. With such demand being put on FC’s during these challenging times we just want to bring it to your attention that as SFP sellers we are able to alleviate some of that demand on FC’s while maintaining the customer experience Prime members have come to expect. Not offering the fastest potential shipping method is causing a negative experience for our mutual customers and leading to lost sales.Please see the attached screenshots for an example where an FBA offer is winning the Buy-box: ASIN B076585D8J. In this instance the item won’t arrive until 5/4. For the same price the customer could purchase from us and receive the unit as early as 3/31 via SFP. This listing doesn’t even show 3/31 as the fastest delivery option, you have to click into “the other sellers on Amazon” view to see our Offer.We have maintained our SFP metrics for years and are able to deliver products to customers within the SFP shipping window. But, customers purchasing the item from an FBA seller will need to wait weeks to receive the order. If there was a way to take this into consideration over the coming weeks we as SFP sellers can help alleviate the stress on FCs while maintaining the high level of customer service Prime members expect.Will FBA units with extended ship times lose their prime badge?Will measures be taken to factor the faster ship times SFP sellers can provide for non-essential items and the ability of SFP sellers to maintain the Amazon Prime member experience?vault snip 2 with delivery date.PNG1920×1047 388 KB",Fulfillment By Amazon

772,"High shipping costs from China, Long delays, Amazon not checking in inventory, out of stock, ugh","Hey everyone,Just a rant here. Maybe some of you can relate.Shipping from China right now is EXTREMELY expensive and unstable. One day, the price will be $8/kg, then the next day it will go up to $14/kg. Ugh.Also, there are many many cancelled flights, making delivery time for freight about 20 working days door to door.And, to top it off, Amazon is SLOW in receiving inventory right now.This is my peak season and I’ve been out of inventory for a couple months. Learned a big lesson this year regarding sitting on enough inventory. The thing is, I sold out of product about 4X faster than last year, needed more inventory, the China shut down… then the US shutdown… Now I’m getting daily emails from people wanting to buy my product without any inventory.

I’m not sure if Amazon has just seen the volume on our account or our massive YOY growth.However, as Amazon has lifted restrictions for sending in certain ASINs, I noticed we are currently over our storage limit. So my question is, are there currently COVID-19 related storage limits on some selling accounts? Or were we just coincidentally given a storage limit lower than our current usage due to our IPI?

The customer should be taken care of immediately so I’m not worried about the refund (even though I’m expecting reimbursement)… but I have opened 2 requests to have the feedback removed and the criteria for removal is as stated in the first denial email…Contains obscene language.Contains seller-specific, personally identifiable information.Entire feedback comment is a product review.Entire feedback comment is about fulfillment or customer service for an order fulfilled by Amazon.The fourth bullet point explains my situation perfectly because the customers review was simply “Received (item) instead of (item)!!”. Considering that it was FBA how is this not an immediate removal? The greatest part of it all, when I got denied on the second feedback removal request, the criteria for removal changed! Looks like the guy handling my case took it upon himself to not list the other bullet point that actually validates my removal request…• The feedback includes words commonly understood to be obscene or profane.• The feedback includes seller-specific, personally identifiable information, including email addresses, full names, or telephone numbers.• The entire feedback comment is a product review. For example, “The Acme Super-Widget lacks the sharpness and speed of the Acme Ultra Widget.”How is Amazon allowing this behavior!? I’m sitting here with a next to perfect feedback and a more perfect account health score and have done EVERYTHING in my power to be an ideal seller and I have to just take a 1 star review and lose money for an Amazon error… Mind blowing…",Fulfillment By Amazon

Then another 7-10 days pass for the order to get checked in, and then 7-14 days to get dispersed to the necessary DC’s.

843,Tam level 2 amazon bot?,"I know we are all equally frustrated to receive an incompetent response for feedback removals that are in violation of Amazons guidelines. Now, worse than that, we are seeing feedback not even being given the chance to be appealed.

Did so in plenty of time but was charged $28.50 for item cancelled and not received anyway. Please remove this from my card.”As we know, being sellers we have NO ability to view or adjust billing charges (recurring) subscribe and save and this is entirely handled by AMAZON. Secondly, this was an FBA order in which our customer stated they did not receive it? So why is Amazon charging our customer or not cancelling their subscribe and save and then allowing us to be downrated?Im fine with rolling the dice and hoping I can communicate issues to a human which “most” of the time is able to rectify - however, now, beyond not following their own policies, I can’t even appeal to a human being?@Chris_Amazon@SEAmod",Fulfillment By Amazon

Yet they also insist my smallest item FBA fee which is greater in cost by 75 cents is correct. The answer given is “our system do not compare measurements between listings.” Given these are different types of cosmetic products it seems outrageous to be charged such a higher rate for smaller item. It’s like pounding sand trying to get them to think outside the system and check it, and come back with an actual explanation. Ideally I’d like to not charge 75 cents more than I have to since every penny I can save the consumer from having to pay over the $5 retail price would be helpful in this case.

My product is about the size of a piece of paper and 2 inches thick weighing 1.5lbs. No special hazards either.My question is, is this normal for new sellers to have a low storage limit?

905,NCX for crushed item that passed drop test,"My ASINs are small and fragile, so I hired an independent inspector to verify they passed the drop test and other criteria before sending them to Amazon FBA for fulfillment. Several customers have complained the product is arriving crushed, and asking why such a fragile product isn’t being sent in a box. I sent Seller Support screen shots of those customers’ comments, along with a request the products be boxed.When I contacted Seller Support, they did their own drop test, with the following results:“We have received a response from our fulfillment center team and here are their findings:What type of drop test was performed (6 sided, 17 sided et cetera)? 6 sidedWill additional prep reduce damage to the customer? YesDid the product pass drop test? YesWas the box recommendation followed? YesDoes the box recommendation make sense based on the box and items shipped with this order? Yes”Seller Support concluded their analysis of the problem by saying “your box recommendation has been considered.”I wrote back, asking what their reply meant, and noting the ASINs are fragile, subject to breakage caused by machine handling or by having much heavier packages fall on them - that a simple drop test doesn’t adequately address the problem of breakage for fragile products.Seller Central responded back by quoting chapter and verse of the prep requirements:“The units were improperly prepared prior to being sent to an Amazon fulfillment center.Products you send to FBA must be ready to be packed for shipment to the customer. No additional preparation should be needed to store and pack your products. Any additional preparation or labeling required upon receipt at the fulfillment center causes delays and may result in charges for unplanned preparation or for non-compliance with FBA policies and requirements.The units on your shipment required bubble wrapping.Units that are fragile, made of glass, or are sharp may require additional bubble wrapping to be safely received at an Amazon fulfillment center. Make sure your packaged units can pass a 3-foot drop test onto a hard surface without breaking or leaking. A drop test consists of five drops:- Flat on base- Flat on top- Flat on longest side- Flat on shortest side- On a corner• DO NOT leave empty space in the package, which may lower the chance of the product’s ability to pass the 3-foot drop test.”I’m struggling to provide a great customer experience, but it appears the economics of a bag versus a box is getting in the way. The problem seems particularly prevalent now that the shipping venues are all jammed, packages are moving at higher velocity, and are more likely to be dropped (or thrown) one on top of one another.How can I get to the other side of the matter, and have Seller Support consider consumers’ negative experience?",Fulfillment By Amazon

I checked the Restock Inventory page regularly to see when and if I can ship in more units.Today I found the “Utilization” (total units in Amazon FC including customer orders) for this ASIN stayed the same for 3 days and it currently exceeds my Maximum so I cannot ship more in.I found it weird because it’s not happened like this before so I checked the transaction view of my account balance and it showed the last time Amazon shipped this ASIN to customer was 4/26 (4 days ago).This is a big problem becauseI cannot ship more in obviously (Utilization > Max) and I’m out of stockthe Max allowed continues to decrease because it is based on sales in the last 30 days, and the longer I’m out of stock the “total units sold in last 30 days” will continue to decrease, driving down my Max allowedIt’s a downward spiral meaning I will never be able to ship in any units because the gap between Utilization and Max continues to widen.Does anyone have this problem with your ASIN? that Amazon is no longer shipping your order to customers?

918,Used Sold As New - Account Review,"Ive reviewed a lot of discussion in this forum about Used Sold As New topics. Helpful especially input from @ Shelf_Cleaning_Capit. Unfortunately still deny and now my account is under review and I have 3 days or else.
Heres the story:
Its started on last November, 2019, we received one listing removal. We appealed, spent a whole business day to gather information, provided manufacturer invoices, etc. Denied. Tried again with more info, denied. We gave up and let go the ASIN remain closed.
Starting in March, 2020, our nightmare came again. Another ASIN removed for same reason, Used Sold As New. We investigated, appealed, denied. We gave up but this time we keep receiving listings removal one-by-one until within less than two months (Mar 23-May 19) we got 8 listings removed. We fought two of them but failed. Since Covid-19 our hands are tied and Im stuck in foreign country because of lockdown/border closing. So I desperately need all the help now to keep our 11 years old seller account here. I even willing to pay personal Amazon Account Manager but dont know how to apply.
We are an Authorized Partner of one of biggest electronics manufacturer in the world. For security and privacy reason, we prefer not to disclose the name here. So for the sake of discussion, just say Apple. So there is no issue with the sourcing, invoices, packagings, product quality, etc. After investigation we concluded those listings removed due to Bot detecting few buyers use words such as used, refurbished, or scratch in their email, return reason, Feedback or Product Review. I really meant a few since only one or two buyers in each listing did that before my listings removed. Some of these buyers just an opportunistic buyers that trying to get some credit back because we 100% sure the items we shipped are brand new in factory sealed but they claimed otherwise.
One very interesting fact is few weeks before Mar 23, we reported our main competitor to Amazon for changing the pictures of one of our best seller listing to match their inventory. The listing originally created by us back in 2017. Since March, their listing is no longer exist in that ASIN so we assumed Amazon removed it and we suspect they retaliated. We obviously have no hard proof for this last statement, just the fact is very coincidence that happened and also the fact that this seller happen to be in ALL of our listings that got removed(half of them are the ONLY other seller in those listings).
We politely email them last month, asking to stop. They kindly reply that they did not do such things. However after that there is no further listing removal or buyer issue. Go figured. So we thought issue done but seems Amazon catching up with this issue and now asking me to do POA for all 9 listings(including Nov 2019). Appealing one listing never successful, ever, so to say Im very desperate is really under statement.
Heres the example of one of my POA, please assist. Im also tag MOD here for assistance. Thank you all in advance for your kind assistance.

922,How to Handle Used as New Complaints Version 2,"This is my second thread regarding used as new complaints.
You are reading this because you received a message from Amazon like this
We removed some of your listings because of customer complaints about items listed at the end of this email. Customers may be complaining because the items they received did not accurately match the condition or description of the product mentioned in the product detail page of your listings.
Why did I receive this message?
Amazon has several product detail and listing policies to ensure customers have a consistent buying experience and receive items in the condition they expect. Products listed in ""new"" condition are expected to arrive in brand new, unopened condition with no signs of damage or wear. If customers receive a product that does not match this description, it may lead them to perceive the item as being previously opened or used.

The issue(s) that led to the complaints about the product condition or description of your items.
You will have to do some research.
Look under Account Health (in Seller Central, look under the Performance tab) Voice of the Customer, Customer Feedback (all feedback, not just negative), Buyer-Seller Messages, FBA Returns (Reports, Fulfillment, FBA Returns), Product Reviews.
For FBA Returns, each item will have a sticker that has begins with LPN This LPN number will be unique to a return.
Note that some times it takes a few days to have information show up.
Once you have information, then you have to decide what to do about it.
Examples of problems that occur
Customers receiving damaged or broken items
Customers receiving damaged packaging.
Customers demanding perfect packaging for collectible items (which is not guaranteed by new standards)
Amazon using bubble mailers instead of boxes or not packaging properly.
Improper seller preparation.
Actual defects in the product packaging.
Incorrect detail page information: factually inaccurate, misleading information, insufficient information
The actions you have taken to resolve the issue(s) that caused the complaints about the product condition or description of your items.
State what you have done here.
Things you could or should do.
Check existing inventory at your place of business.
Request a bin check with Amazon if the items are in FBA.
Close the listing temporarily if the issue(s) you have warrant it.
Ask your supplier about any issues.
The steps you have taken to prevent future complaints about the condition of your items.
Again once you have the information you have, what are you doing about future issues?
Do you need to change how you ship these to customers or into Amazon?
Do you need to do something to the packaging to improve it?
Do you inspect all or some percentage of your items when you receive them for defects?
Do you check the detail pages before you list an item?
Also, focus on general business practices.
Sourcing and other questions
Sourcing: Are you sourcing the product from a trusted supplier that sells items in condition?
Listing: Is the product accurately described on Amazon? Have you ensured that there is no ambiguity and the customer is well informed?
Packaging: Is the product in its original manufacturer packaging as listed on Amazon?
Shipping: Have you taken all appropriate steps and quality checks to ensure that the product is stored, packed, and shipped appropriately, and will not be damaged when shipped?
Review your communications, reviews, and feedback from buyers to better understand the issues.
Copy and paste these into your Plan of Action.
Answer each one directly. Yes,
At this points, you have 3 parts to your POA.
Policies Amazon asked you to review. You copied and pasted them telling Amazon you reviewed each of them.
ASIN specific questions: what went wrong, what did you do about it, and what will you do in the future.
Do this for each ASIN in your correspondence.
The questions about sourcing.
Your next step is to send invoices and receipts.
If you have a different address than on your Amazon account, explain that.
If the invoice or receipt is over 365 days, state this.
Make sure you clearly explain anything that is different than you were asked.

How to deal with Used sold as New Complaints
Account Health
There is a new, updated, thread on this topic as of Jan. 2020: How to Handle Used as New Complaints Version 2 Amazon has changed the way it shows sellers customer complaints. This is a new thing and there are specific ways to deal with them. INFORMATION ONLY. OPEN A NEW THREAD, WITH YOUR DETAILS, FOR HELP WITH SPECIFIC PROBLEMS OR APPEALS. For the record, I received 7 of these and Amazon accepted my POA on all of these. What do the complaints mean? Amazon is compiling negative experiences 
Draft your POA just like you have been advised to and include
The last communication from Amazon in its entirety. You must include all they sent you and the ASIN(s) affected.
Your last response to Amazon.
There may be reasons why all of the communications are needed.
Important things to note
Always send your POA in form of an email. Attachments will not be opened.
Expect that Amazon will call your supplier.
Do not use any software to modify your invoices. This will be flagged as forging an invoice.
Print out invoices, scan, and attach them.
Read everything carefully and provide what is asked.
If you are providing something that is different than what Amazon asks for, explain it at a level a 10 year old can understand.
Product condition complaints sit under the Account Health tab for 6 months and then go away.
You should find causes of problems, not just accept blame. If there is an issue, identify it, and deal with it. I see too many sellers who just fall on the sword and take blame. You are responsible to resolve a problem, not necessarily fall on the sword
If you know that a buyer is abusing the system, report them.
Amazon wants sellers to take their customers seriously. They want to know you are doing the things that responsible businesses do. They rightfully want sellers to pay attention to customers complaints (valid and invalid) and take appropriate action.
On the used as new complaints, you should expect to hear a response within 24-48 hours.
If your plan is accepted, you will receive a message similar to

I request that the comments here be updates or improvements to the thread or success stories.
I have had numerous sellers not read the thread and not do what is asked. This is a volunteer forum and there are people who do not like wasting their time. They will not offer help if they do not get needed information.
I have offered help with POAs previously, but cannot guarantee I can anymore. I do not take money for my time and have no interest in doing so.
I have been suspended twice from the forums and am basically not participating here anymore. I do not like how I and others are being treated and will simply spend time elsewhere.

I am a new to selling on Amazon and was unaware of their one account per person policy so I accidentally got both my accouts suspended and despite all the appeals I was unable to get them back. Ive been trying to close both of them so that I could open a new one but Amazon doesnt allow suspended accounts to be closed.

924,Restricted product violation,"Hello,
We have open cases about this issue but have yet to get a resolution. We have waited longer than 72 hours on some cases (which is the recommended amount of time to wait according to the message shown to us after submitting our case), and this issue has been prevalent for more than a week.
On June 5th 2020, our listing for a UV lamp was removed from Amazon. It was identified as a UV lamp which requires an EPA establishment number and therefore classified as a restricted product. This was a correct assumption by Amazon and we acknowledged this.
We followed Amazons guidance in the message and have been waiting ever since to hear back. We have:
Closed the offers for the ASIN
Provided images of all sides of our packaging, including the side that includes the active EPA establishment number.
Provided the PDF certificate of the EPA establishment number registration and approval on EPA letterhead.
Provided the Batch ID in which we updated our offer to include an image of the side of the packaging that includes the EPA establishment number.
Already took and passed the EPA test on Amazon successfully (this is how we were able to sell this product initially, we are US citizens).
Provided a PDF attachment showing an email reply from the contact of foreign EPA establishment entities, confirming that our EPA establishment number is valid for further proof.
The first reply to the case we received stated that the EPA establishment number was not found in the EPAs national list of active establishments and that the product could not be reinstated. However, this is because the EPAs national list is updated on a quarterly basis. The list was last updated in March 2020, however our EPA establishment number given by the manufacturer was established and active in April 2020. The list will not be updated until July 2020. This is the reason we provided the PDF certificate of the EPA establishment number on EPA letterhead.
After responding to this with the above documentation, we have not heard back at all.
Is there nothing else to do at this point other than wait for a response? Is it ill-advised to request status updates on the cases that are currently pending amazon action, or will this further delay a response? We have not received any updates from Amazon, not even so much as a response stating that they are still waiting for the internal team to get back to us.
Would love to get assistance with this or have our case expedited if at all possible.",Account Health

Additional information
Dear Seller Performance Team,
Thank you for taking the time to read my appeal. My name is Mike, the owner of Mike Discount, which is a company that is selling items on Amazon. I am writing in response to my account suspension due to Product Authenticity issues, and I have devised a corrective plan of action. I understand that I have mistakenly violated Amazons policies. First, I would like to apologize, and stress that I am determined to make sure this error does not happen again. Following this complaint, I have set a number of procedures in place to ensure that we will not get any future infringement notices.
I would like to address the violations that have led to my suspension which I believe are as follows:
The root cause of the issue:
The ASIN: B06XD4QKFB; was not authentic. However, this item was listed as a mistake, as the product that I was trying to sell was iittool, and has a different UPC number, which is 039593764501. The root cause that led to this issue was that the item was searched for by typing the name of the item instead of by the UPC code, as it should have been done. I assumed it was the same item by looking at the picture instead of verifying that it was the correct UPC number, and therefore my listing was added to the wrong ASIN and picture. This item was supposed to be listed under iittool with UPC 039593764501. This error was due to my inexperience in selling on Amazon. I have the invoices for the product mentioned, and I am enclosing pictures as well.
I was not aware that I was not allowed to sell item B06XD4QKFB without receiving actual approval, as I did not see a Request Approval button when I added this ASIN. Instead of requesting approval from Amazon Central, I listed my product under the wrong ASIN number and wrong UPC due to only looking at the picture, instead of reading the item description and UPC along with the picture.
I failed to take the time to read your policies regarding the Amazon Anti-Counterfeiting Policy.
In the past I have listed all items from the Amazon Catalog with the item name instead of by UPC, as it should be done.
Contravention of Amazons Prohibited Seller Activities and Actions Policy and Anti-Counterfeiting Policy.
I did not act in a reasonable timeline to stop showing the listings with this irregularity of authenticity; due to lack of knowledge of this item being inauthentic or patent.
I failed to check my account health performance regularly.
Due to my lack of experience, I did not take into consideration Amazons specific parameters when listing products, stocks, and policies. However, I have compiled a list of immediate and long term corrective actions that are listed below to make sure this error does not happen again.
Immediate Corrective Actions:
The listing ASIN: B06XD4QKFB has been deleted permanently.
The following have been permanently removed
ASIN: B00W0IMDZU
ASIN: B07HFGVBVS
ASIN: B07F1X1BYH
ASIN: B07RZVR8VP
ASIN: B0863ZJ4K9
I have reviewed all of my listings to make sure that they conform to the standards aligned with the Amazon Intellectual property Policy (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/201361070 1)
I individually checked all of my items to make sure that they fully match the item description in order to ensure that it does not violate Amazons policy for authenticity or patent.
All new items will be checked to make sure that the description matches the UPC before listing it on Amazon.
I checked the UPC for all my listings for any patent registration.
I have used the website USPTO.GOV to check for copyright patents and trade mark logo for all of my other listings.
I turned on alerts for daily performance notifications and for my account health
(https://sellercentral.amazon.com/performance/dashboard)
When posting new listings, I will search for the item picture by UPC number instead of by using key words
If I had listed my item under the name iit with UPC 3959376450,Title:100ft 30m Tape, then it would not have violated the brands intellectual property. I am enclosing invoices for this item with the UPC picture.
Actions taken to prevent this issue in the future:
I will do a thorough review of every ASIN before adding to Amazon inventory in order to make sure that the product completely matches the description.
I will double check all other listings weekly and make sure each item has an accurate description and picture to ensure that the customers have a full understanding of the products that they are purchasing
All inventory will be sourced by contacting the brand owner directly or directly from the manufacturer in order to find verified suppliers.
I will request invoices or letters from my suppliers for confirmation in the quality of the products.
All item will be listed thoroughly, inspected for authenticity, and fully match the description and other details on the Amazon product page.
I will have my suppliers sign an agreement to acknowledge that they are sending good quality and permitted products.
Any cases of client dissatisfaction will be investigated and evaluated immediately, and clients will be provided a refund or exchange of product. The returned product will be thoroughly examined once it returns to the warehouse.
In order to avoid any future inconveniences, I will send the products directly to Amazon for approval and verification of existence and quality of the product, in addition to making sure that it is not violating any product authenticity. I will not list any items under ASINs or categories that require approval unless it has been verified
When posting new listings, I will search for the item picture by UPC number instead of using key words.
I will continue to check my account health dashboard for alerts and performance notifications.
I will use the website uspto.gov to check for copyright and patent for any new listing items.
Going forward, I can guarantee that customers will be sure that they are buying an authentic product in outstanding condition and in original packing from my store. In following these steps, I believe I can add value to Amazon, customers, and suppliers. I sincerely apologize for my untimely and previous unsatisfactory appeals. Amazons Performance Team has generously given resources to these guidelines, and I have taken the time to read through the program policies in order to ensure my actions going forward are best practices. It is a privilege to sell on Amazons Marketplace. I will respect this platform, be diligent to sell products at the highest standards, and adhere to Amazons Business Solutions Agreement. I will be careful not to replicate these mistakes, and I would be incredibly grateful for the reinstatement of my Seller Account. I am constantly working towards improving my store and service.
Thank you for your time. Please accept this as my formal appeal.
Sincerely,
Mike discount

Additional information
The root cause of the issue
The root cause that led to this issue was that the item below was listed in
error. I did not search the item by the UPC code and just searched by key
words. I assumed it was the same item because of the picture and therefore,
my listing was added to the wrong picture.
The actions you have taken to resolve the issue
I have thoroughly checked uspto.gov for copyright and patents. I have also
gone+ through my account health dashboard and have read through
polices. I have I have also removed the items that have were listed in error. I
have double checked each of the other items that are listed in Mikes

928,Need Help Determining Why Automotive Accessories were Restricted,"Hi everyone, our account has had some restricted product violations in the past week for some vehicle accessory items, primarily truck bed covers. The truck bed covers that were removed are just vinyl and/or metal covers that cover the bed of a pickup truck. At this point Im concerned about getting more restricted product violations because I have no idea why these products were marked as restricted, which makes it impossible to determine which other products in my catalog I might need to remove. Has anyone had a similar issue? Ive opened a case with seller support, but the only replies Ive received so far are just links to the restricted product policy FAQ. Below are some examples of the titles of items that were removed:

929,Unfounded Suspected IP Violations,"I had a listing removed by bot (not a complaint filed by trademark/patent owner) for possibly infringing on a Louis Vuitton design patent number ""US - Reg. No.:3576404 The patent Is for a checkered wove and weave exterior pattern. My handbag is purple with a cross with wings on it. It is in no way similar to a checkered pattern. The Louis Vuitton name was also not used anywhere in the listing or key words so I have no idea what triggered this bot.
I never received an email about this bot suspected potential infringement or an email address to appeal to. I was only able to appeal to Seller Support who keeps telling me why the listing was deactivated and does not review the picture of the Louis Vuitton patented design vs the picture of my bag to see they are in no way similar.

931,"Amazon Shut Down Our Familys Business, and We Have No Idea Why","A tough lesson on partnering with the most powerful cyborg in the world.
Jeff Bezos can do whatever he wants. He has earned that much power. He deserves it. He built the most expansive and efficient system the world has ever seen.
But behind the shiny happy commercials is a soulless cyborg with no human compassion.
Amazon shut down our business last week. Without warning  A cryptic and vague automated email delivered the news.
Account deactivated.
Over the past several years, I put my heart, soul and thousands of hours into creating this business. It took all our money and a lot of failures  but we finally did it. Amazon customers love what were creating. We just took a 100k loan on our house to buy more inventory.
Our family was all in on this business. We provided the ideas, design, capital, products, labor  the creativity. Amazon provided ultimate customer trust and unmatched logistics and fulfillment. It seemed like a win-win relationship.
Your Amazon seller account has been deactivated in accordance with section 3 of Amazons Business Solutions Agreement. We found that your account is related to another account that may not be used to sell on the site. As a result, you may no longer sell on Amazon.com through this account. Due to the nature of our business, we do not provide details on our investigation methods.
What does that mean? I have no idea what that even means.
Id heard many horror stories over the years. Amazon shutting down huge businesses with no warning and no explanation.
For sellers theres no such thing as calling Amazon  or speaking to a human.
All communication is done through a black hole of a back-end portal. Here you can fill out a form to send correspondence that will go out to either a robot, or to somewhere far away usually within a few daysor weeksor maybe not.
Upon receipt, the robot  or drone will choose an auto-responder it feels is related, and the case will be closed.
File your appeal:
The form was short enough. But I couldnt answer any of the three questions. I dont know what Im appealing. I dont know what were being accused of.
Upload evidence and relevant documents.
Of what? I clicked submit.
You must upload evidence and relevant documents.
Day 3  I still dont know what were being accused of. I had to shut down all the listings on our website because Amazon holds most of our inventory in their warehouses Not to mention the money in our account. And increasingly apparent, all the power.
I helplessly wait. My wife and I dont sleep. No word from Amazon.
One day while I researched new ways to sell our products, a Seattle number calls my phone. I try not to sound overly eager when I answer.
Its a real human.
He tells me that our account has been deactivated because its related to another account. I explain to him that I dont understand and that I will do anything to help rectify the situation.
He tells me that he does not have access to any more information and cannot help me any further.
He instructs me to update the appeal.
Update the appeal with what?
I do my best to update the appeal. I speculate about what the issue might be. I apologize for whatever it is. I offer to provide anything at all they might need. I ask for more information about what this is regarding.
I send it off to the cyborg and waitAnd worry  and speculate about what this could all be about  if this could really be the end of us and Amazon.
We put everything we had into creating this business. I quit my job. I was finally following my passion and talents. We were creating new things that people love and giving back to the world through the foundations that we support.
Weve yet to make a dime of profit  Everything so far has gone right back into the business. But it didnt matter, because we were making people happy and getting better at what we do. Amazon customers loved what were creating and wanted more.
No response for daysI continued to bash myself for relying too much on one platform, when my phone rings. Its a Seattle number. Im surprised to hear the same human on the line.
The name of the account you are related to begins with the first three letters W-i-l.
W-i-l???
I dont know any accounts, businesses, passwords, anything that start with those letters? Could someone have hacked my account? Do you have any other information to help us figure out what this is all about?
This is the only information I have. You will need to submit another appeal.
He hangs up. Im more confused than ever.
I submit another appeal.
Ive racked my brain and cant think of anything at all that begins with W-i-l. But Im willing to provide any information you need. Is there anything other information regarding this account that can help me file a better appeal?
I send it off into cyberspaceI waitNothing
DaysNothing
Lack of sleep combined with anxiety and uncertainty send me spiraling. At one point, the pain and unresponsiveness bring me to break down  A grown ass man crying, alone in our garage. Helpless in a relationship with a cyborg.
What if I communicate with it like a human?
I log into the portal and write from my heart.
Dear Amazon,
Im wondering if I could talk to you today?
I literally feel sick over this whole situation.
Ive put my heart and soul into creating this business. Weve invested thousands of hours, and all of our familys money. All of our efforts the past few years have gone into making each Amazon customer happy, and reinvesting into making new products that people love.
I do everything from my heart with a moral compass of doing what I love and trying my best to make people happy. Weve yet to make a profit, but it feels so good to use our talents and effort to do something positive. Our business is supporting global reforestation and has helped plant 1,272 trees so far. Our other business is committed to the Vanderpump Dog Foundation for canine abuse.
The stress that this uncertainty has put on our family is unexplainable. Not knowing why our account was suspended is the worst part.
I understand that Amazon is a business and has their own agendas and guidelines. I want to operate according to these guidelines, and believe that we will be a valuable asset to Amazon.
Is there anything we can do to find out more about our situation? Ive racked my brain and cant think of any stores or accounts we might be related to that starts with Wil.
Any personal communication and advise you might be able to offer would mean everything to me.
Thank you Dave

Am I able to see particular comments from buyers so I can rectify this? I dont know how buyers felt this way or why? 1 or 2 or more? And why they thought item was used. Genuinely stumped.
Only thing I can think is that we may have, on the very rare occasion, re-used outer packaging (always clean and previous labels removed). Thought we were doing a good thing for the environment. We certainly wont do this again (just guessing this might be the reason).
If anyone has experience with this and knows if I can directly access data from buyers on why they thought an item used (or photos), Id appreciate it.

934,Another related account suspension,"Hi guys, my first post here (long, apologies) and youve probably guessed already: I have an issue with my Amazon account.
Im a brand new seller on Amazon and created my seller account on the US marketplace 10 days ago (professional account, but as an Individual not a company). A few days later, I received a notification that my account was being reviewed and after uploading documents to verify my identity, I was pretty quickly approved.
I was at work when I received the approval notification and was pretty excited. I started playing with the SC app and possibly the desktop version on my smartphone while connected to my company WIFI network (I know now that its a stupid mistake but I didnt know at the time of course).
Shortly thereafter I received the infamous mail announcing my account deactivation due to a related account that may not be used to sell on our site, with no date nor further explanation.
Ive never sold on Amazon and I dont have any other seller account in my household (only buyers account with different email addresses and also a Business buyer account for my company) so the only reason Im thinking of is the use of the WIFI network.
For additional information: maybe its a glitch in the system or I did something wrong, but as soon as my US account was activated, I started receiving notifications of registration in the international marketplaces (EU+JAPAN). My Japanese account was also deactivated shortly after the S account but not the EU marketplaces. These latter markets required further ID verification but I finally got approved to sell in the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy. And this account is still active right now while the US and JP have been deactivated 10 days ago.
So Im now in a situation where my US and Japanese are deactivated and my EU account is live. I dont understand this situation. If there was a related account, I guess the EU accounts should be deactivated as well. I think the problem is that i have accessed my SC account through my company network, which is UK based but uses proxy server based in the US (and possibly around the world).
Im posting here to have the views of the experienced sellers as well as seeking advice to write an appeal and a POA (I was too quick to make a first appeal thinking my honesty would be sufficient to reinstate my account but it was obviously rejected).
Thanks for your kind help.",Account Health
935,Section 3 - related to another account,"Hello,
I am very new at this and I cant understand what I have done wrong. I need a little help, please.
I have received from Amazon our Amazon seller account has been deactivated in accordance with section 3 of Amazons Business Solutions Agreement. We found that your account is related to another account that may not be used to sell on the site. As a result, you may no longer sell on Amazon.com 6 through this account. Due to the nature of our business, we do not provide details on our investigation methods.
They give vague reasons and I dont know what to think.
Facts are:
I dont have another seller account. I had a buyer account and I have deleted it and sent the proof to Amazon (I know that I am allowed to have 1 buyer and 1 seller account but just in case).
I havent logged on my seller account from any other device than my computer.
I had never had another Amazon account, no one in my household did and by definition I have never had a suspended account.
I have asked for permission to sell on other stores in EU by mistake (yes, I am that stupid). Maybe that could be the problem?
My Amazon seller account is brand new, I havent had the chance to make my listing yet.
I have sent an appeal in which I have stated that I have deleted my buyer account and that I asked for access to sell on other stores by mistake. I dont have any other ideas with what I could have done wrong.

936,"Used Sold As New Plan of Action, FBM, Brand Owner","Hello there!
Weve received the dreaded Listing Removed by Amazon because ASIN was deemed as a Used Product Sold As New. I have read over nearly every forum that has information regarding how to write a proper Plan of Action (a lot of very helpful information, thank you!); however, our situation is a bit different.
We are FBM. We are the brand owner and are brand registered with Amazon. We manufacture our own products (signage) in house and ship ourselves- we are a small team of 6. A customer claimed she received a dirty, used sign, which we are assuming was damaged by the courier in transit. We are fine with accepting that and making a plan of action that reflects such. But how do we produce an invoice for a product that we print ourselves? Will an invoice for raw materials be acceptable?
I have read that the Amazon review/performance system is NOT set up to handle self manufactured products, and that claiming to be a brand owner registered on Amazon does not bypass the need for an invoice.
Any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance.
@Shelf_Cleaning_Capit, @Oneida_Books yall have been very helpful, any insight on our situation?",Account Health
937,Rejected trademark report,"I have found a seller that is selling products and is using our trademark on their listings.

Amazon responded with the generic, we respect the rights of distributors to enter into agreementsor whatever.
I was successful in the past in reporting a violation of this type but havent been able to recently. I have registered the brand and trademark, and am a brand owner. It is beyond frustrating that I go through all this trouble and then get rejected over and over again when it comes to protecting the trademark and such.

939,Please restore our seller account or refund to us immidiately,"Our seller account was suspended by amazon because the items we listed violated the policies and guidelines for adult products. We are very sorry for this. We have taken actions to improve our management,but for a new seller, we feel it is very unfair for us.
We review that the reason for our mistake is that our operators searched the amazon links for similar products listings before they listed our items. They found other sellers liested their items at Massage Tools under the Health and Household categories not at the Sexual Wellness categories. So they mistakenly thought it wouldnt violate amazons policy, so they did so.
For example, B085PPB5HL, B084C2BPRX and B0827SS5LC are all sold in the health and household categories, however, they are still sold on amazon as usual, and the link is as follows:

Please confirm the above links and check if they have violated amazons policy, why they are still alive for months, so as to confirm that what we said is correct, and also hope you can give us a chance,because we didnt do it on purpose, but it happened. Now we promise we will make improvements, and guarantee that we will never violate any amazon policies again.

940,Related Account Suspension - Through Mexican Account,"Earlier in the year I opened an Amazon account for my US company and was shortly suspended for document verification, which I then appealed with the appropriate documents and my account was reinstated.
About a month ago I received an account suspension from Amazon Mexico (in spanish) saying that my account was related to another account that was suspended. I did some investigating and found out that my brother had opened an account for his Mexican company to sell on Amazon Mexico and he received a suspension for confirmation of documents (utility bill, etc.) right before I received my related account suspension, so I assume this is what Amazon is referring to.
My brother and I live in different countries and the accounts are for different companies and will sell different products in different marketplaces.
Per the instructions, my brother reactivated his account by sending in his documents and then I filed an appeal describing the origin of the problem, the actions taken to solve it and the steps taken in the future. This appeal was sent on 5/14 to Amazon Mexico. I have yet to receive a response. I dont care about using Amazon Mexico but this also suspended my US account which is the one I care about. There is no way to appeal through the US account, only through the Mexican account which I have.
It has been almost a month since the Mexican appeal and I have not received a response. Should I just keep waiting? Is there any way to deactivate my Amazon Mexican account? Would that help me solve this problem?

Then I elaborate a POA and send it:
Dear seller performance Team
We have carefully read your last email and after understanding what you need from us we have investigated and learned what is expected from us.
The reason you are listing products that you are not approved to sell:
Our current process to list products on Amazon is to enter UPC on the ""add a product"" section and match it with the product we buy from our suppliers, If the search results in a sell product button we list it if we get the ""Apply to sell"" button we try to get a letter of authorization or the invoice from a reputable source.
We thought if the Sell this product button appear we only needed the invoice from the supplier.
Steps you have taken to resolve this issue:
I have closed and deleted my listings for all of these ASIN. I will not relist them until I am positive the listing is accurate and my inventory has the right packaging and also have the approval from the Brand or authorized suppliers.
I have looked even more carefully into my other listings to make sure they are accurate, I have made sure there isnt any ambiguity and that customer understands what they are buying.
For the Listing with the Asin B075SLSZTM, Ive fully refunded the money to the buyer and also closed and deleted the listing.
For the ASIN B07NS5DPX2, Ive provided 2 Amazon Invoices accounting for the inventory sold. Ive also closed and deleted the listing.
For the ASIN B0788TRQLX, Ive also closed and deleted the listing.
How you will prevent this issue in the future?
I will designate a person to monitor all of our supplies and listings to carefully check whether they have a trademark or patent and we will make sure theres no Brand or category restriction.
Before listing an item, it should satisfy its listing conditions. We will check that the product is accurately described on Amazon, making sure there is no ambiguity and the customer is well informed.
We will make sure that the product its in the original packaging as listed on Amazon
We will regularly check inventory for manufacturer defects and damage.
Implementation of Supplier Review Policy (SRP). Purpose: Ensure a valid supply chain and respect amazon seller guidelines.
Implementation of Product Review Policy (PRP).
Here is the resume of the ASINS Status:

POA
Root Cause:
Product description does not adequately describe what this looks like when brand new.
Buyer with order 112-xxxx-6861865 purchased two disc golf discs and wrote a message: This disc look used. It is scratched up badly and dirty.
We are certain that this complaint is in regard to the X-line PDx and NOT about the S-Line TDx. The X-line plastic normally has a scratchy/mottled look when brand new from the manufacturer as this disc is made from a very soft plastic with a flat sheen which causes this scratchy appearance when viewed with differing light angles. This normal appearance of this disc could cause a buyer that is inexperienced with this product to think this was used/scratched/dirty, as the color variation could be confused with dirty and the scratchy appearance could be confused with used.
I am certain (I packed this myself) that this complaint is descriptively an exaggeration, yet it was the buyers opinion.
We acknowledge that not all buyers will be familiar with the product they are buying and what to expect in the discs appearance.
Corrective actions taken in regards to this order
We messaged the buyer 3 times, but have not received a reply back, a return request, or feedback.
First message was an apology with an explanation of how the P1x normally looks and an offer for a return/refund
Second message was a standard customer service enquiry asking if he had any problems.
Third message was directly asking if we answered his concerns to his satisfaction regarding this disc and asking if there is anything we misunderstood that we needed to correct
I submitted description updates for this ASIN and all other similar ASINs which state: Note: Because this plastic is very soft, surface is scratchy when brand new
In addition, I reviewed these 2 items in our inventory (no issues abnormal issues found, but some have been removed from being able to use for an Amazon order as their color and appearance could be misinterpreted). I spoke to our staff to brainstorm for anything I might have missed.
Preventative measures and product condition/processing standards
Current standards:
Product packaging: Like all disc golf discs, there is no packaging - original packaging issues do not apply.
Discs are stored in a clean environment and our multiple inspections make it impossible to sell a product that is actually dirty We have sold over 100,000 discs with the only time dirty was mentioned is this time.
Product returns: Because we treat each item as unique, these are removed from our inventory when sold. Returns are not serialized. These can not be selected for Amazon orders as selection is done by serial number and these are stored in a different location.
Discs are packaged in carded #4 padded envelope with soft plastic internal lining which is superior to the packaging Amazon uses for the same items.
We only sell new discs. We have a documentation trail created through serializing each item and taking its photo such that we can trace its status back to the exact invoice it arrived on.
Inspections
1 First inspection is when this item is received. Each individual item is entered into our inventory, noting color and weight. This is done on an item by item basis.
Second inspection is when the item is photographed and labeled with its serial number.
Third inspection is when the item is pulled for packing.
Forth inspection is confirming the item is correct when packed and shipped.
New actions taken
We added to our staffs inspections the question: could someone that doesnt know this product think it is used or dirty. Our staff is asking this question with a level of paranoia. This additional check is used to catch a potential problem at each stage; from product listing to final packing. Solutions when we question this condition include:
Adding additional product information on Amazon listing
Switching to a different item for shipment when a particular color may be misinterpreted as dirty.
Adding a note with the product packaging about normal appearance since some buyers do not read the product descriptions on Amazon.
Deleting ASINS from our catalog that may be too problematic.
I have already edited multiple listings descriptions beyond the ASIN that caused this problem, which could have similar issues.
Message from Amazon
This is the message received PRIOR to creating the above POA which we have not submitted yet.
Message from Amazon:
We received your submission but do not have enough information to reactivate your listings at this time.

Here are a few things to consider as you create your plan:
Sourcing: Are you sourcing the product from a trusted supplier that sells items in new condition?

Your Amazon seller account has been deactivated in accordance with section 3 of Amazons Business Solutions Agreement. We found that your current selling account is related to a different selling account created which violated our policies and is not allowed to sell on our site. As a result, you may no longer use the current selling account to sell on Amazon.com.
Im well aware of this policy. But I do not have a second account. I never have. I received the same email to the same email address twice. At first I thought it was fraudulent but then I logged in and sure enough there is an issue.
The instructions in the email instruct me to
1. You must first reactivate the related account by submitting an appeal. Please follow the instructions in the communication received for that account.
As I already stated I have no other account, so I have no idea how I would accomplish this

POA I wrote:
Dear Seller Performance Team,
Our account has been suspended due to complaints of inauthenticity. We take any complaints of inauthenticity very seriously and can confirm we have already put steps in place (as detailed below) to prevent it from happening again. The complaints are in relation to 
Complaint type: Inauthentic Item
ASIN: XXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXX
The issue(s) that we believe caused the complaints about the authenticity of our items -
We believe the complaints have occurred due to the item being listed incorrectly on Amazon. The creator of the listing changed the listing image which caused the customer to believe they were getting something different to what they received. We sent the wrong product to two customers in total. We have now removed the listings from our account to prevent this from re-occurring in future.
We also received complaints regarding items getting damaged whilst in transit as a result of rough handling of our courier. We now work with a more reliable courier company to ensure all deliveries are handled with care and delivered correctly to the customer to eliminate any complaints of inauthenticity. We take full responsibility for the account suspension, it has taught us a number of lessons, and we have changed how we will operate our business and run our amazon account going forward as described in the steps below. Customer service and order satisfaction rate is extremely importance to us as a business. We can confirm all issues have already been resolved with a full refund to the customers satisfaction.
We have attached invoices to show that the products are authentic and sourced from our trusted supplier

BXXXXXX SXXXXXX
Address info: xxxxxxxxxx
Phone : xxxxxxxxxx
e-mail: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
web: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
The actions we have taken to resolve the issue(s) that caused the complaints about the authenticity of our items -
We have liaised with all complainants to offer refunds/replacement items where appropriate if we receive any complaints directly, as is our policy.
We have introduced thorough staff training on Amazons Anti-Counterfeiting Policy, we will make sure we work to the following policies and guidelines;
 Amazon Anti-Counterfeiting Policy
(https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/201165970)
 Policies and Agreements
(https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/521)
To avoid generic customer complaints, we will ensure any queries are dealt with efficiently and all messages are responded to within 24 hours during working hours. We will also carry out daily performance audits to monitor and review our performance metrics to ensure we are performing to and maintaining Amazons targets.
We fully understand that we are responsible for ensuring that the products we offer for sale areas advertised, legal and authorised for sale.
The steps we have taken to prevent future complaints about the authenticity of our items 
We have changed our courier company to a more reliable one to ensure parcels are delivered to the customer in a perfect condition.
We will closely monitor all shipments to customers and keep customers updated as and when required. If any issues are highlighted during our monitoring we will review and upgrade our shipping processes as required.
We have upgraded our packaging to prevent any damage to orders whilst in transit. We will bubble wrap every order and ensure there is sufficient packaging surrounding the product, we will also include fragile labels on the outside of the package all of which will protect it from any damaging elements whilst in transit.
We have checked that the images in our remaining listings match the product exactly to prevent similar complaints in future and to prevent any ambiguity.
We have implemented a thorough quality control process whereby all items are checked on arrival to ensure they are in full, undamaged manufacturers packaging. We will also ensure each item is properly sealed. This will ensure items are in perfect condition and match the relevant listings before being sent to customers. They are stored in our air-conditioned warehouse, and are never exposed to any damaging elements.
We only list and sell items that are purchased either directly from the manufacturers or trusted authorised suppliers. Furthermore, we verify all suppliers authorised status with the manufacturer directly to ensure any inauthentic items do not reach our listings. We have rechecked our inventory to ensure the authenticity of all our remaining listings and to ensure we have the right to sell all items.
We will not list against an ASIN that does not match our exact item description. This will prevent inauthentic complaints and manage customers expectations.
To summarize , we have implemented a number of controls which will prevent customer complaints.
We assure you that we have resolved all the issues that caused our account suspension and that we are committed to providing customers with a positive buying journey. We have had lots of positive feedback from customers and would like to continue this success with Amazon.
If you have any queries or need any further information please do not hesitate to contact us.
Best Regards,
Answer from Amazon:

Sourcing: Are you sourcing the product from a trusted supplier?
Listing: Is the product accurately described on Amazon? Have you ensured that there is no ambiguity and the customer is well informed?
Packaging: Is the product in its original packaging as listed on Amazon?
Shipping: Have you taken all appropriate steps and quality checks to ensure that the product is stored, packed, and shipped appropriately, and will not be damaged when shipped?
Review your communications, reviews, and feedback from buyers to better understand the issues.

Its not easy for seller to run an account ,please give some confidence and chance for seller to do business on Amazon like some website aliexpress humane to do business.The didnt frozen all the fund for the account if they delete the listing when the get the notification and continue to sell other product.Because the store still had other product to sell to comply with Amazon policy.

958,So this is how it is,"I have been selling on Amazon for 3 years now. Perfect metrics for the last 3 years. I dont bother anyone, I dont violate any policies and have never been accused of doing so, I just sell and make money for myself and Amazon. Im here to do what most sellers are here to do, provide for their families while adhering to all policies. Im currently suspended and have been suspended only once besides this one. Both because of the same reason and person. I had absolutely no idea why my account got targeted for suspension this time around. Being completely honest, it blindsided me. No performance notifications, no policy violations, nothing. After finally speaking with an Account Health Specialist they told me because of a Patent Infringement for the same company that filed a Trademark Infringement against me 3 years ago which got my account suspended. We are currently Trademarked, Copyrighted and Patented.
The first time we got suspended due to Trademark Infringement, Amazon accepted the Trademark Infringement on their part. I was clueless at the time thinking this must be an error, how could Amazon accept a Trademark Infringement on the mark that I currently own? After speaking with an American Seller Support Representative at the time, they looked through the whole listing with me and found absolutely no Trademark Infringement nor Copyright Infringement on the Listing as everything on the Listing was my own Trademark. This is when I learned what malicious competition is. I send a POA with my Trademark and was reinstated in a few days.
Lets fast forward to March and May of this year. I received TWO Patent Infringement from this company again on the same listing. I successfully appealed and got my listing reinstated. Then around the first week of May I receive an account suspension with no information at all. Just the Section 3 and thats it. After finally being in contact with an Amazon Health Specialist they let me know that the company contacted Amazon and told them that they never retracted the complaint against me so Amazon decided to suspend my account.
So the first time around with the Trademark Infringement, it was all lies as I currently own the brand with certificate and everything on USPTO. Then the second time around its all lies again as the Utility Patent they are mentioning is not even in the creation of my product. Its not in the description, functions, pictures, nothing. A simple test buy will let them see as well as anyone else, that its simply not there. Before I manufacture any product, we do a full Patent Scope on it to make sure that nothing will violate any IP Rights. I respect others as well as others have respected mine. Even if it was which it isnt, I have evidence of manufacturer, sales and wayback machine that it has been sold online since 2011 and their earliest filling effective date is on April 2014!
So Amazon decides to suspend my account AGAIN over the same company complaining just because my products rank is a lot higher than theirs. Even after submitting the comparison between our products and my publication date of this product since 2011,I have been wrongly suspended for weeks now with no response from the notice-dispute Department. I have submitted Section 273 on USPTO, comparison between our products, over 1,000+ customer reviews stating how my products works, links with articles and pictures that my product has been sold online since 2011 and still nothing.
So this is how it is? Anyone can submit an invalid false complaint against a Listing, and then the Seller or/and the Listing gets taken down that easily and then it takes us months to get back our rank and our bank accounts how it was before due to malicious competition and nothing happens to the competitor? They can just keep submitting and submitting and nothing ever happens to them? Perfect Metrics, Trademark, Copyright and Patent Certificates should at least protect us before getting taken down.",Account Health
959,Trouble Understanding ODR,"Hi,
Im an experienced seller (10+ years). Im used to looking at the Account Health page and check it regularly. Currently we have an ODR of 0 (as we usually do) as we are very attentive to customer issues.
However, the way that the ODR is now being calculated confuses me. The ODR says 0 of 16 orders in the past 60 days.
The 16 orders is where I am confused. We have 16 orders a day sometimes - in the 60 day window shown (Mar 27 - May 25) we had over 600 orders!
Anyone have any idea where the 16 is coming from? I am concerned as with this low a total, even one crazy customer can make a big problem!

960,Account Suspension Appeal Feedback,"** I got this email about a recent account suspension. Received on May 29th**
Thank you for talking with us about your selling account.
As we discussed, recent activity on your account violates Amazons Selling Policies and Seller Code of Conduct, and your account has been temporarily deactivated. At this time, funds will not be transferred to you but will stay in your account while we work with you to address this issue.
Why is this happening?
The Amazons Selling Policies and Seller Code of Conduct prohibit:
 any attempt to manipulate ratings.
 any attempt to manipulate feedback.
 any attempt to manipulate reviews.
 any attempt to manipulate sales rank.
 any attempt to misuse Amazon A-to-z guarantee.
How do I reactivate my account?
To reactivate your selling account, please submit a plan of action that describes:
 The methods used to obtain orders that violate Amazon selling policies including placing orders for your own products.
 A list of the orders placed in an attempt to manipulate sales or misuse the A-to-z guarantee.
 The steps you have taken to prevent sales manipulation from going forward.
After sending this appeal/PoA below on May 20th
Dear Amazon Seller Performance;
My accounts performance has failed to meet Amazons standards and policies and fallen short of my goal to provide excellent customer service.
The main issue was violating a Code of Conduct when I tried to manipulate a customers feedback and review. The other issue I was using other competitor keywords in the search term which caused the misuse of Sales Rank & Search and Browse Violation.
A. The Root Causes of the Problem
After a full investigation and from the performance notifications I found that:
I violated the Seller Code of Conduct policy by trying to manipulate a customers feedback and review by deleting a review in return for a refund on several items. These order numbers are 113-1610082-7703418, 112-9650052-2701058.
I violated a misuse of the Sales Rank & Search and Browse Violation by using wrong or irrelevant, repeated keywords, product names, and competitor brand names in Search Term for my ASIN. About 10 of the items have been used. We never updated these listings according to Amazons policies.
I listed some items twice to get more sales. About 20 active listings were duplicated. I listed several of them at different prices. This is a violation of Sales Rank & Search and Browse. These are the following ASINs samples in violation 1 - (B06X924JRD, B072BM2XWP), 2 - (B06Y4FS9KC, B0736D1JT4), 3 - (B07B8TB1SJ, B07Q1W162Q).
B. What we have done to fix the problems
I have carefully read all of Amazons Seller Code of Conduct and its Prohibited Seller Activities, the complete policies and agreement section. The actions above were in violation of Misuse of Sales Rank, Misuse of Feedback, Ratings, or Reviews. I have acknowledged and read the policies.
I understand that feedback is an expression of a customers shopping experience and I will not manipulate customers feedback or reviews in any monetary form.
I removed the active listings that were duplicated for the same product and double-checked to make sure no more items were duplicated, inactive, or active ones. The following ASINs were examples removed of this violation B072BM2XWP, B0736D1JT4, B07Q1W162Q.
I have removed the competitor brand keywords in Search Term on my ASIN. Also, I have made sure the listings to make sure they are in compliance with Amazons policies. I have read Using Search Terms effectively to better optimize and correctly.
C. This is how I will prevent future complaints
I will not engage any forceful attempts and manipulation to influence reviews in the future. I will not ask any customer to remove or change their reviews, positive or negative. I will make sure that each customer on Amazon will be satisfied with their order.
I will properly and effectively use keywords in Search Term that complies with Amazons policies, to prevent future violations from happening.
I have already deleted about 20 listings that were duplicated and will continue to review each listing to comply with Amazons policies. I will make sure to use the correct information only for my listings to avoid future violations.
All the above steps will help make certain that my account complies with Amazons policy to provide customer satisfaction.
I have never wanted to violate Amazons policies but I failed to understand and review them. Therefore, I familiarized myself with the Prohibited Seller Activities and Actions. I believe I have identified the issues that led to my suspension and my desire to make changes going forward.
I would like to have my selling privileges to be reinstated.
Thank You for your time.
Any feedback on both of them would be great and much appreciated",Account Health

Really appreciate some help to figure this out. I have 2 selling accounts as approved in email by Seller Performance from December 2016. Account #1 does all of the volume, and #2 has not been used for over a year, with minimal o activity since then.
Account #1 was suspended first, and then 15 minutes later Account #2 was suspended.
Account #1 is suspended because selling account is related to a different selling account which violated our policies
and then Account #2 is suspended because your account is related to an account that may not be used to sell on our site.
I want to put my best foot forward and create the best appeal, but it seems that each account is just blaming association with the other one as the reason for suspension, with nothing shared as to why/what the original suspension/policy violation is. Whats the best approach here?
I can think of a few errors I made in the last few months in Account #1, but should I be getting into those since they were not mentioned in particular? Really appreciate the help.

Does deleting the listings with claims make the claim go away? I ask this, because these are old listings, and three I cant edit to make the claims go away, as Im gated now on the brand(Magic the Gathering), but I wasnt four years ago when I stopped selling the items. Yes, I know now that I need to delete old inactive listings.
Does having trademark misuse claims pending make me lose the buy box? I have many listings now where I am like .20 cheaper and the delivery day is sooner than other sellers, but I cant get the buy box to save my life.
11 claims are for old Mega blocks sets still listed as mega blocks and not mega construx, two I was able to fix by simply changing from mega blocks to mega construx the current brand name, but they were recent claims from May 20th, the 9 claims from may 5th cant be fixed, I guess I waited to long, but I didnt get an email or notification about any of these, I only found out when I went into my account health to check my on time delivery stats.

Most of these products include ingredients that can help with immunity but the product listings mention nothing about Covid 19 and are not specifically Covid related products or medical products. These are just typical dietary supplements that happen to have ingredients that people use to boost their immune system.
We have contacted seller support multiple times and they just consistently reply with the same response which is to visit https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/GU5H4KPBMUFE6XHH. We did this and filled out the New Listing Creation Requirements for Personal Safety and Household Products form over a week ago even though these products arent new and nothing. No acknowledgement or anything to indicate it was even filled out.
Meanwhile we have thousands of dollars worth of inventory that we now cant sell that was perfectly fine to sell just a couple months ago. Any one have any idea how to deal with this?",Account Health

968,Buyer Sent Broken $500 Item Back Then Filed A to Z Claim,"Hello, recently I had a buyer return an item because they did not read the product listing and bought a single dumbbell instead of two. I let them return it and they sent it back broken, then filed an A to Z claim.
The box was very damaged, the dumbbell was scratched, the adjustable weights were warped out of place and cannot be put back, and the handle was also broken off it. It had no scratches, and an attached handle on it.
Additionally in regards to the A to Z claim they had three false statements on it:
Different from what I ordered. In our communications with eachother they admitted that they thought it was 2 dumbbells when the listing clearly says 1 dumbbell.
Returned over two weeks ago. I got this return Monday.
Reached out to seller about the item. Never got a response. They just messaged me today and opened a claim a few minutes later before I had time to respond. The times they contacted me I responded within 24 hours.
My question is what should I do now? Amazon generated the return and I think those are insured? The box was pretty crushed. I also know that Safe-T claims are used sometimes but I dont know if I can do that at this point. Thanks for the help!",Account Health

972,Policy warning for Adding duplicate child variations?,"After creating a new parent-child relationship, we received a policy warning with 2 reasons given; we understand the first, but the second is something we havent seen and we dont know what its talking about.
Why did this happen?
Sellers on Amazon.com are not allowed to add invalid variations. This includes, but is not limited to:
 Adding children products that are not actual variations of the parent product (e.g., newer version or model of product, different branded products, etc.).
 Adding duplicate child variations that are not substantially different than other variations within the family (e.g., Red 1, Red 2, Red 3, etc.).
Variations Corrected
Parent ASIN: B0xxxxxx6M
Child ASIN(s): [B0xxxxxx4I B0xxxxxx9Q B0xxxxxxV2 B0xxxxxxV2 B0xxxxxxPX B0xxxxxx9Q]
How does one create duplicate variations? This seems to imply there are duplicate ASINs and then list them on under the same parent. As far as we can tell, we dont have any duplicate ASINs. What we do have is multiple SKUs for a given ASIN, for selling FBA and FBM at the same time.
The corrected variations section supplied by Amazon lists two duplicate ASINs. Could this be related? Does having different SKUs for a given ASIN make it possible to create duplicate variations accidentally?
Any insights would be much appreciated!",Account Health

975,Account Deactivated (New Seller) (Help),"Hi everybody,
Im a new seller on Amazon with about 30 active listings.
Amazon randomly deactivated my seller account this afternoon stating that I needed to provide an invoice, or receipt, etc. (for 3 products that were already active). I listed them over a week ago and had no issues until yesterday.
I was already authorized to sell these products and had no issue listing them.
An Amazon Seller Rep sent me an email requesting me to send an invoice and make an appeal. I dont have an invoice or want to make any appeals. So I send them a clear receipt with all info.
I receive an automatic message stating that they cannot proceed with my submission. They are basically asking me to provide the same info for 3 products that were and are still active on my listings.
If a seller isnt authorized to sell a product, Amazon would require them to go through a step by step process. Request approval, etc. Sometimes the product is instantly approved to sell. This second scenario is my case.
Thus, I have no clue why they are doing this. I have pending orders needing to be shipped. However, I have lost access to everything, not to mention funds, etc. Its pretty insane how this company operates. It seems like they just freeze your account and thats that.
I already contacted seller support and have attached the same receipt again.
Does anybody have any advice?

976,Account was suspended for review,"Our account was suspended for review promptly after opening the account. We went into this without much knowledge of how difficult and strict this process is.
We are trying to sell from a corporation that exists and operates inside of the US, but some of my marketing team is in Europe. A person in Europe created the account in his name as a contact for our corporation.
He initially submitted the corporations bank statement along with a credit card from the parent corporation to the aforementioned corporation. An email came that it was rejected because he didnt submit the full transaction history, along with a second email requesting his ID card. He then send a bank statement for the corporation with full transaction history as well as his passport.
Soon after Amazon charged the card we had on file and sent the Welcome emails. The European colleague logged in and immediately saw the suspension notice. We then received the following email.
Hello,
For your security, we have suspended your Amazon seller account. During our review, you will not be able to sell on Amazon. Please ship any open orders. If you have any funds in your account, they will be available after any amounts paid for A-to-Z claims or chargebacks on your orders have been deducted. This usually takes about 90 days, but funds may be held longer.
Why is this happening?
We need additional documentation to verify your identity. If you currently sell on Amazon , we need to verify a change to your payment methods. If you did not make this change, contact Seller Support.
How do I reactivate my account?
Please provide the following documents and confirm that there is a valid credit card on file:
 A bill that is dated within the last 90 days for piped or natural gas, electricity, piped water, or internet service with name and address visible
 Business license, if applicable.

 I have two Amazon selling accounts. They were both simultaneously deactivated last Thursday June 4, 2020 by Amazon. The first account was created as an individual account in 2013. I made my first listing in 2014. It did not sell. I joined FBA and upgraded to a professional account in 2015. I then immediately started selling. I was approved by Amazon in early 2019 to start the second account. Account Health on both accounts exceed all performance metrics and show no policy violations. 
 The first accounts performance notification suspension letter says  We found that your current selling account is related to a different selling account which violated our policies and is not allowed to sell on our siteIn order to reactivate this selling account, please follow the steps below:
You must first reactivate the related account by submitting an appeal. Please follow the instructions in the communication received for that account.
Once you have successfully reactivated that account, please submit an appeal to reactivate the current Selling account.
The second performance notification suspension letter says:  We found that your account is related to an account that may not be used to sell on our site. As a result, you may no longer sell on Amazon.com. In order to reactivate this Selling account, please follow the below steps:
You must first reactivate any and all accounts that have been enforced for policy violation by submitting one appeal for each enforcement. Please follow the instructions in the communication received for that account.
You can also appeal enforcements by signing into your primary Seller Central account and accessing your Performance Notifications for each region in which you operate an account. Submit an appeal for all accounts, except the account that is deactivated for a related account, by clicking the appeal button in the notification received for each account.
Once you have successfully reactivated that account, please submit an appeal to reactivate the current account, by using this link: https://sellercentral.amazon.com/performance otifications. When submitting the appeal, you will need to provide us with the name of the account that was reactivated and the date of reactivation.
Both notifications also say I can report there being an error. One says I can explain that my account is not related. The other says I can explain that I dont own a separate account. That is what I did initially. On the second account I used the error link under the plan of action on the appeal page. I told them there is an error because neither of my accounts have any policy violations at all. I have zero policy violations of any kind in either account. Also, I have permission from Amazon in writing to have two seller accounts. I have included the written permission in attachments. I do not have a third account and neither of my two accounts have any reason to be suspended.
They rejected that by sending We found that your account is related to another account that may not be used to sell on the site. As a result, you may no longer sell on Amazon.com through this account. Due to the nature of our business, we do not provide details on our investigation methods.
I then spoke to Account Health support and they told me to appeal on the other account (my first account in which I had done nothing with yet). They said to send in tax documents. At the error link under the plan of action on the appeal page I sent in everything I could think of. I sent a Passport, Social Security Card, two invoices, Drivers License, Tax Return, Sales Tax Permit, EIN, DBA form with my business name, gas bill, and electric bill.
They rejected that with We found that your account is related to another account that may not be used to sell on the site. As a result, you may no longer sell on Amazon.com through this account. Due to the nature of our business, we do not provide details on our investigation methods.
I spoke to Account Health support again and they basically said seller performance confirmed that the other account is mine. They asked me if I had any other accounts. I said no. Then I thought really hard and said that maybe I had created another account a long time ago and dont remember. I gave them a bunch of email addresses that I have had over the years. They identified that two of them have seller accounts that were terminated. I have no memory of ever creating any other seller account.
A long time ago I was just considering starting an Amazon business. I am wondering if maybe I made another account or started the process of making another account but then never used it. I did not have another Amazon account that I let get suspended for policy violations.
Of the two Amazon selling accounts that Account Health support says has a terminated Amazon account, one of the email addresses I no longer have. The other email address I went back and searched for any email from Amazon. I found no email saying I created a seller account. I did find an email that says its from seller performance but the email address is seller-info@amazon.com It was on 3/31/17. It said that account was closed by Amazon because of inactivity. It also says they would be delighted to see you return. When youre ready, simply register a new account. When I try to log in to that account on seller central it says ""Not Authorized We dont have a seller account associated with that email address.
So I wrote a plan of action and submitted it on the appeal where you can submit more information. Here is the POA.
Plan of Action
What was the root cause that led to the issue?
I found a related Amazon seller account under the email address soonerfan255@yahoo.com That account was closed by Amazon because of inactivity. I have an email from Amazon notifying me of this. I attached a screenshot of the email named accountclosed.png In the email it says Amazon would be delighted to see you return. When youre ready, simply register a new account. When I log in to that amazon seller account it says Not Authorized We dont have a seller account associated with that email address. I have attached a screenshot of this with the name noaccount.png This account being in closed status is what caused Amazon to deactivate my current Amazon selling account.
 My account has zero policy violations, exceeds all performance metrics, has over 4 years of successful selling experience with over 7,000 successful orders and a 96% lifetime positive feedback rating with 138 total feedbacks. I adhere to all Amazon policies and always give world class service to Amazons customers.
What actions will you take to resolve the issue?
 The related account was closed by Amazon due to inactivity. It was not deactivated for any policy violation or failing to meet any performance metric. All actions have been taken to resolve the issue. 
What steps will you take to prevent future issues?
 I will not violate any Amazon policy on any Amazon selling account. I will meet all performance metrics as well. I will not open an account under any other email address without a legitimate business need and the approval of Amazon.

Here is
Complaint type: Used products sold as new, products arrived broken, chipped or damaged or defective products, therefore needs buyers to glue themselves, gouged all over on the plastic front, Certain items might be re-boxed, products not as advertised, Not glass screen, Plexiglass is NOT transparent, Hazy, dull, making the photos not seen clearly. Shy of 8x10Inch, does not fit 8x10inch photos properly. Do not stand up on its own on a flat surface, the back easel not working well. Cheap, and frame needs repainting. Markings or recycle logo on the plexiglass.
As Amazon sellers, we noticed that we made a big mistake in our business, not only hurt the customer, but also harm the Amazon platform. In fact, all of our products are brand new, made of New Zealand wood material. We sincerely promise that all of our picture frames and other items are new in condition. They are all purchased from the authorized and trusted supplier. We have been knowing our supplier for several years. We visited their factory once a month. Sometimes a few picture frames might be mistaken as used frames because they were damaged or cracked during the transit.
As for the front covers, they are made from eco-friendly plexiglass/acrylic. Customers thought the acrylic cover are glass from our images on amazon. But we indeed stated it clearly that all of information are stated clearly on our website. You can check our website at any time. Usually, we will tell buyers how to use our plexiglass, because we asked our suppliers to put films on BOTH SIDES of the plexiglass in case of scratch and dust. Some picture frames might look cloudy, and hazy, dull because our suppliers forgot to put a film on the plexiglass due to this yearss serious disease. To be honest, we used the plexiglass to replace the real glass to reduce the damage and broken during the transit. Because we tested the 2 material for many times. The truth is that it is indeed more fragile and vulnerable if we used real glass. Even we labeled each box with fragile logo. Regarding the size,
Some buyers complained that their frames does not fit 8x10 inch photo, actually, all of frames do not fit exactly same size as the photo size. For back easel, we already asked our team to investigate this issue. We encourage our clients to contact us with their concern if they are not satisfied with our products. We will take full responsibilities for any quality issue. Also, sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
Immediate Actions We Will Take To Resolve This Issue;
We closed this listing immediately and a few problematic listings. We also deleted a few listings and decided to shut down the production of these potential problematic products. We created a removal order for those unsellable and wrong inventory items.
We asked our Quality Control team to check all of the current inventorys condition type before shipping to FBA warehouse, to make sure all products are in good and totally new condition. Every products were asked to double check in order to make sure our originally packages are intact and in good condition with minor damage if possible. Instructions are included as well. Our team were required to dispose the defective box if there is any sign of visible imperfection. Our suppliers were asked to check the current original package as well. Each package should contain foam to protect each corner of the frames. And each package should be printed with Fragile or Easily damaged logo because our products should be lightly handled. We also asked our salesmen to contact amazon fulfillment center people to check if there is any problematic issue with all of our products.
All of our listings were thoroughly checked on their bullet points, or shorter paragraphs, images, key attributes, especially ASIN B07M951GCQ. We already put the important information on the primary position, so that buyers will not misunderstand it. Including, our picture frames are made of MDF material. NON GLASS, JUST Acrylic cover(Protective films on BOTH SIDES needs to be peeled off before using, Recycle logo is printed on films, do not worry.) and package condition(If met any quality issue, or hazy, dull plexiglass cover, or with scratch, damaged, please contact us for a replacement or a full refund). We also added the exact photo frame size image to our listings. So, buyers can exactly know what kind of size they bought.
Some of our products are now storaged in our US warehouse. We will ask our team to check the current status of all of our products. Unqualified products will be disposed once found.
We properly vetted our current suppliers. We believed that we should make our requirements on products more clearly to them. So, we can work better on each other. Besides, we also asked 3 experienced workers and 1 salesperson to go to our cooperated factories to check the process of their production. In order to make sure there is no more defective products, we already asked them arrange 2 people to check every process of production. They were asked to check the condition of moulding machine as well.
We used original suppliers package, and all of our products are designed and produced only by us. We did not sell other sellers products without authorization. And you can check our products at any time, because this product are fulfilled by amazon. And most of our products are fulfilled by amazon as well. All of our products package are printed with our brand FRAME YI.
Our carriers were required to ship our products more carefully. We asked them to use experienced truck driver to ship our products to make sure they are little damage during transportation. We currently work with DHL, Fedex and USPS company. Our manager already talked them with this shipping issue about our frames today. We made an agreement on this, and we will pay for the extra shipping fees for this.
We asked our salesmen to check every review, feedback, buyers message, voice of customers, A-Z claim, buyers complaint, buyers questions, and account health dashboard, and performance notification, etc. We would either issue a full refund to them or send them a new item if buyers are not satisfied with our products. And we messaged and commented customers who has issue with our products.
Steps to prevent further similar issue.
We will arrange at least 2 quality control members and 1 salesmen to visit our current suppliers twice a month. If there is any problem, we will work it out together. We will resolve everything at the beginning. Quality is the first and foremost issue we both need to focus on. We now only acquire from creditable dealers and providers if we look for new products suppliers. And ensuring all future invoices will have the proper information.
We would make sure all of our products are brand new. Firstly, We will test a few samples from our factories including durability, package condition before once we received them. Then Arrange 3 experienced Quality Control workers to double check the condition of all products and packages. Make sure each product is in its wonderful condition before shipping, including storage method, package, and fulfillment channel. Salesmen are required to thoroughly inspect every aspect of our products to ensure the items condition and package condition to meet Amazon guidelines, and correspondent with their detail page description.
3)For the returned or used products/items, we would either removed them to our warehouse and then destroyed them, or create a disposal order for the returned and defective products directly.
We will ensure all of our listings titles, product descriptions, and bullets be clearly written and images will meet amazon guidelines, so to help customers understand our products easily. Experienced salesmen will be responsible to double check after the products were listed on amazon. Any misleading, or misunderstanding information may be found, we will immediately close our listings and correct them. We will only provide accurate information on amazon and our customers at all times and will update information if these is any change on our products,such us material, package.
5)We would improve package material to prevent damage, and randomly test products for function. E.g. We actually has already used much thicker and wider frames and require stronger packing and shock-proof measures at the factory. Use PE foam to pack each products corners to avoid the broken in future. Each of our products are printed with Fragile or Easily damaged Logo to remind the carriers to handle them with care. Better transport services change logistics service providers.
6)Our product will come with a warranty giving customers a replacement or refund within 120 days of purchase if the product does not work as expected. Any exceptions to this condition description will be mention on our product detail page. We would not let the similar incidents bother you again. We would listen more to our buyers to keep improving our products. We would check the review, feed backs, buyers messages, voice of customers every day to see if there is any issue with our products.
7)More Durable and thicker Material, Using High Quality Glide Tackle, Adjust the Molding Machine
Use high quality material - We would ensure that all of our frames will use more thicker MDF material to avoid further damaging during transit.
*Using premium quality glide tackle to make each corners firm in case there is any more damage upon arrival.If its not stable enough, we will ask factories to double the glide tackles.
Finely coordinated production condition - We would strengthen the quality governance of our factory condition. Arrange 2 more people to check the picture frames details and quality every month.
*Packaged in more durable boxes- The frames will have their 4 corners being packaged under our foam. Each of the frames will be checked from detail to detail before shipping out.
We made an agreement to buy new mold machine, since buyers have size problem on our picture frames. So, factories will adjust the size of frame according to the buyers requirement. We will remeasure our frame according standard 8x10 inch frames in American.
8)Make Sure Each Plexiglass is Clear and Transparent, Protective Films Needs to be Put on Every Frames.
*We will make sure each plexiglass is clear, clean, no gouge on the front. And protective films will be definitely put on both sides in avoid of scratches, and dust. We will put an label on it - Please peel off the films on BOTH SIDES before using in case there is more misunderstanding.
*We tried to use real glass to replace the acrylic front cover, since some buyers think the picture frame should come with real glass. And we are still testing this before putting them in to practice.
*We already asked factories to put a User Guide in each package. There will be instruction if there is any problem with our products. We also uploaded video on our product detail pages to tell them how to use our products.
We would love to be subject to Amazons supervision and examination. We would take the full responsibilities once there is any similar issue. We are committed to complying with Amazons policies, and We sincerely invite you to consider other buyers feed backs and reviews, communications, and voice of customers, some of which left us with positive feedback and comments.

It was not our intention to open up accounts in other regions. This only happened after we inadvertently opened accounts in new regions when having an account with no issues in another region. We only wanted to change our listing to FBA.

Filed Appeal:
My business partner and I listed our book for sale on Amazon.com today and we were trying to change it to fulfilled by Amazon. I clicked the link to Get Started on this page, https://services.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon/benefits.html 12.
I was then bombarded with emails from a multitude of international Amazon sites and a small charge to our bank account because of this, I believe. I was then notified by email that the account was suspended.
I do not know if this had anything to do with it, but I had just edited my Author Central profile. My partner was going to do the same and ended up having to change his password around the same time this all happened.
With the above explanation of events, I believe we did nothing wrong and our account should be reactivated.
Please answer the following questions so I have a better understanding of the issue:
Does the description above have anything to do with the account being suspended?
What did we do wrong?
What was the root cause that led to the issue?
What actions do we need to take to resolve the issue ASAP?
What steps do we need to take to prevent future issues?

Dear GoFishMedia,
Thank you for submitting your appeal. It has been transferred to the Seller Performance team is now pending their review.
Whats Next?
Once the review is complete, the Seller Performance team will send you a notification. Your account will remain under review until the status has changed. Please refrain from sending another case with your documents/appeal included. Duplicate submissions will slow down the review process.
You can view your account performance at (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/performance/dashboard?ref=ah_em_op 3) or select Account Health on the home screen of the Amazon seller app on your iOS or Android device. Your Account Health shows how well your account is performing against the performance metrics and policies required to sell on Amazon.

It has been TWO WEEKS since I provided my submission through Amazons system, and to this day I have not received any response from Amazon. I have called in to support twice as they provide the option to talk with a health specialist. I also responded to a case requesting an update on the appeal, and Amazon is marking is as ANSWERED without responding anything.
WHAT A JOKE!
These people have no idea how to help any further as they can see the information that I provided. They just inform me to wait it out because if you submit more information, it puts you in the back of the line.
IN THE MEANTIME, Amazon is holding well over $20,000 of my funds which they have no problem keeping until my account is resolved - which is putting us in a VERY tight position financially because of personal and business bills.

987,Trademark Infringement Suspension,"Hello,
I need some help from anyone that can provide some help with my POA. I originally submitted a POA and Amazon responded asking for greater detail. I have attached the original POA, Amazons response, and my next proposed POA. After doing some additional research on our root cause, we determined it was slightly different and have reflected that in our second POA attempt. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!
Original POA:
The root cause of the issue
____ has been selling on Amazon for over two years and have never had any violations until the month of May 2020. All of our FBM inventory is sourced through two reputable distributors www..com and www._.com/ which we have attached our recent invoices for your verification.
The root cause of our 3 infringement violations were due to our internal listing creation procedures. Our previous procedure was to purchase items through our national distributors ___ and ____ and list the items on Amazon. After reading the Amazon product policy requirements we now understand that we must request approval from the brand owners directly before attempting to resell these items on Amazon.
The actions we have taken to resolve the issue are:
The three listings which were in violation were closed immediately after we received notification of the policy violation and will not be attempted to sell or infringe on any trademarks. Additionally, we have removed all of our other FBM listings that may be a potential trademark violation until we can confirm we are authorized to sell these items.
The steps you have taken to prevent the issue going forward
To prevent this issue going forward we have created a new internal listing creation procedure for our team to ensure we are not in violation of any trademark infringement violations. The steps we are taking currently and will continue to take are:
a. Before making a purchase with our distributor with the intent to resell an item on Amazon, we will reach out directly to the brand owners to request the authorization to resell one of their items.
b. If we are granted authorization to resell an item we will place a purchase order through the manufacturer directly.
c. If we are not granted authorization by the brand owner we will not consider making the purchase and will not make any attempts to sell the item.
As an extra layer of oversight, once our team has secured an authorization to resell an item from a brand owner they will now be required to escalate the product to one of our managers. This step will require the manager to ensure all the proper authorizations have been granted before we place a purchase order with one of our distributors and list on Amazon.
Amazon responded to the appeal:
Hello,
Thank you for submitting your plan of action. We reviewed your appeal and determined that it is missing the following information. Please include the missing information listed below in your plan of action:
Thank you for submitting your plan of action. We reviewed your appeal and determined that the corrective action items you have listed have not been implemented. Please make sure all corrective actions have been completed to be in compliance with your plan of action:
 Proof of product authenticity (e.g., invoice, Order ID, licensing agreement, letter of authorization). It must clearly prove that your products do not infringe any intellectual property rights.
 Greater detail on the root cause(s) of the infringement.
 Greater detail on the actions you have taken to resolve the infringement issues.
 Greater detail on the steps you have taken to prevent infringement going forward.
 Greater detail on why you believe an error has occurred.
Has your account been deactivated in error?
If you believe there has been an error, please tell us why. Your explanation should include the following information:
 How your listing(s) have not violated the brands intellectual property.
Where do I send this information?
Please submit this information by clicking the Appeal button on Account Health (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/performance/dashboard).
What happens if I do not send the requested information?
If we do not receive the requested information within 17 days of the original suspension notification, your account will remain deactivated.
Proposed second POA appeal:
I understand that Amazon takes complaints about violations of intellectual property rights of brand or rights owners very seriously. My plan of action will explain what I have done to resolve the issue and what I will do to prevent similar complaints from happening in the future.
Root Cause of Infringement:
After a deeper analysis of our products we have discovered that our goods do not match ASINs: ___, ___, ___. I listed against these ASINS that belonged to other brands because I didnt properly understand how branded listings work on Amazon.
Our product looked very similar to the pictures of the ASINS: ___, ___, ___therefore we listed them under the assumption that they were the same and infringed intellectual property rights for these brand owners.
We do not have valid proof of authenticity for ASINS: ___, ___, ___.
I received policy warnings through our Amazon seller account for trademark infringement rights from the brand owners on 5/21/2020, 5/22/2020, and 5/24/2020 from the rights owners but failed to follow the instructions to reinstate the listings provided in the infringement notices.
Actions that have been taken:
We have removed the three ASINS: ___, ___, ___ immediately after receiving the complaints from our Amazon store and will not relist them again.
I have read Amazons intellectual property policies and now understand how to properly match my products, including the brand, to existing listings in the catalog.
Additionally, we have removed all of our other FBM listings that may be a potential trademark violation until we can confirm we are authorized to sell these items.
Steps taken to prevent the issues going forward
To prevent this issue going forward we have created a new internal listing creation procedure for our team to ensure we are not in violation of any trademark infringement violations. The steps we are taking currently and will continue to take are:
a. Before making a purchase with a distributor with the intent to resell an item on Amazon, we will reach out directly to the brand owner and obtain a written authorization to resell the item in question.
b. If we are granted authorization to resell an item we will place a purchase order through the manufacturer directly.
c. If we are not granted authorization by the brand owner we will not consider making the purchase and will not make any attempts to sell the item.
When we are creating a new listing on Amazon we will not determine the ASIN to list under by the photos. Instead, we will use the UPC of the item to ensure we are listing under the correct ASIN that we have approval by the brand owner to sell.
By now understanding how to properly match my products including the brand to existing listings, I can now ensure that I will not list any items against a wrong branded listing in the future.
I will ensure that our listing complies with all federal, state, and local laws and Amazon policies applicable to potential listings, current listings, and past listings on Amazon.com
Before listing any new products on Amazon I will verify that the products or listings dont violate anyones intellectual property, trademark, copyright, or patent rights using websites such as www.trademarkia.com, www.patents.google.com, and www.copyright.gov
Every Monday we will revisit the Intellectual property policy and ensure we are compliant with any new policy updates.

988,"Supressed ASINs: Corporate sponsor logo, trademark issue","Our situation: We are an authorized Amazon retailer of certain licensed sport team apparel and accessories. This type of sport utilizes corporate sponsorshipsand displays those corporate logos on their apparel.
Even though we are approved to sell these brands on Amazon, we have been getting listings disabled for possible trademartk issues regarding the logo of one of the corporate sponsorslets call them BrandX. We now have 364 disabled SKUs in our account. Some are our best sellers.
Amazons response to all the cases we have opened have been the suggestion to change the brand name in the title of the products to BrandX. We have tried to explain, at this point dozens of times, that changing the brand name would be inaccurate, as BrandX is a sponsor of a team, not the brand of the product. We have had mutliple LOAs drafted by the manufacturer to explain this point and the legality of implied permission to retail items featuring corporate sponsor logos. We have even had several voice conversations with seller supportthe Amazon reps that I speak to acknowledge the validity of our LOAs and acknowledge that they do understand the difference between a brand and a sponsor. We always end the call with an assurance that the listings will be reinstatedand then after the call is over, the case is closed with the same exact result and suggestion to change the brand to BrandX. This has become so frustrating. The merchandise we sell is timely, the apparel is seasonal and changes every year. We are now 6 months into 2020, and these SKUs are still inactive.
We were thinking of paying for a dedicated Amazon account manager to help us with this issue. But we wanted to see if any merchants have had similar experiences, as we do not want to waste the $1600+ per month that an account manager would cost.
Fellow merchants, any suggestions?",Account Health
989,"Account is permanently suspended due to violation of adult policy, which is very unfair","I want to know if my action plan has been reviewed by the performance team
I have submitted it for many days and I have not received a reply
And my store has been suspended for more than 8 months, and the funds have not been paid to me,and Payments-funds@amazon.com has blacked out my email, which is extremely unfair. Now my funds are frozen by the amazon all the time
How is this different from a robber?
Because I didnt understand Amazons policies and rules when I first uploaded the product, I misclassified adult products, the product description was not professional, but the amazon detain my the funds
In addition: my account does not have the behavior of selling fakes and deceiving consumers. According to Amazons Adult Policy Guide, it only suspends or deletes my sales rights, However, the amazon have permanently deactivated my account, and have not given me the opportunity to correct the error. Appealed for 20 times because I would not write an action plan, but all had no effect.but why should my funds be withheld.
Moreover, the customer did not complaint that the product was counterfeit or deceptive. What basis did the amazon use to judge and detain my account funds?
Amazon behavior makes me think it is an internal corruption, it is a shameful behavior.
For a new business seller, when they dont understand Amazons policies and rules,the make mistakes it is inevitable ,Not only did amazon not give new business sellers the opportunity to correct mistakes,

990,COVID 19 - product controls - MODS please chime in,"So I got a restricted products notification due to the new product controls trying to protect buyers during Covid-19 but the notification has some confusing wording to say the least.
My products are non-medical face coverings. Sold at a fair price, high quality, and shipped fast from the USA.
The performance notification says as follows:
""In order to help our customers better find the products they need during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have increased our controls on new product listings for certain Personal Safety and Household products, such as face masks, hand sanitizers, disinfecting wipes and sprays, isopropyl alcohol, and related products.
With this in mind, we have sidelined the products listed above for review. Please see https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/GU5H4KPBMUFE6XHH 7 for additional information.""
So if these are sidelined for review - does this mean an actual human will look at them and perhaps realize they are acceptable items that can actually benefit the world during covid-19 at some point, or do i need to do anything in the mean time? Will I ever hear what the review decides, or will these items start working again or forever be lost in limbo?
Seller support just keeps me in a loop on this saying The concerned team is looking into thisnot very helpful and sadly when I started manufacturing these items, they were not violating any policies and now I have a lot of inventory that should be gone by now
Can anyone clarify what sidelined for review really entails with this type of thing?

Does someone have experience or solutions to provide?
Problem: Our Amazon seller account has been deactivated in accordance with section 3 of Amazons Business Solutions Agreement. We found that your current selling account is related to a different selling account that violated our policies and is not allowed to sell on our site. As a result, you may no longer use the current selling account to sell on Amazon.com.
What we have done so far:
Has your account been deactivated in error - this was an option and I have already submitted an explanation with similar information to Amazon.
I also asked from Seller Support to kindly provide us any hints, why this problem has occurred.
So far I have no feedback, therefore I will try Forum help.
Situation:
We do not have another selling account. We have one account for one company selling in the US market and the EU market. The only difference between the two markets is that primary emails are different.
We have been selling since 2017, mostly in the EU market (98% of revenue comes from there).
Our employees or directly related persons do not have additional selling accounts. We do have one freelancer (managing PPC in the US market), who has is own access to seller central with minimal rights and accesses, but he is related to other accounts also, as he is a service provider for Amazon sellers.
Our US, MX, CA accounts are deactivated, but luckily EU account is active
In the EU market, we have done tons of different POA-s and Proof of Authenticates as we are selling in a complex category, it is like our daily responsibility.
BUT we have never faced such a complaint and we do not have any evidence provided by Amazon.

997,Please help! A few of my Vintage SEWING PATTERNS are falling under Covid-related restrictions,"I have been back and forth with Seller support, catalog team, and apparently Internal Team, and am ready to tear out my hair. Any communication by message results in support staff NOT reading or understanding the problem, and sending me boilerplate messages.
I sell a wide variety of sewing patterns, many of them vintage and out-of-print. A handful of these patterns, several in Amazon FBA, were suddenly deactivated. After a lot of back-and-forth, I finally learn that either because of some categorization or other attribute applied to them, they are falling under the new Covid-related restrictions, and I cannot list the patterns in anything but New condition (and even if they are uncut, I will list in Used condition if there is shelf wear to the outer envelope).
I am having lots of trouble getting Seller Support to correct their internal information so that these few sewing patterns are not affected. Their boilerplate message just tries to explain the policy.
These are sewing patterns for a variety of regular clothing items. This isnt brand-related because most of my other patterns are fine. There doesnt seem to be any consistency in types of clothing items affected (nothing to do with the face, for instance). One affected pattern, I have in more than one size in stock, and the other sizes are not affected!

This is correct and coincides with the about 1700 sales over 60 days.
I noticed this anomaly this past weekend when the figure was correct one day and then I lost about 1200 sales off the figure. And now ever since this past weekend the count down is going BACKWARDS! Every day I have 25 - 50 sales and the next morning the number on the ODR goes in the opposite direction by approximately the same # of sales. Yesterday it showed 98 and this morning I am down to 72. And I had 26 sales over night.
I feel like the countdown clock at the beginning of the movie Independence Day when the clock hits ZERO and Jeff Goldblum says TIMES UP!! I will hit Zero in a few days. I had 1 bad feedback yesterday which is the only one in 60 days but when it shows up on my ODR I will be way over the 1%. That could shut me down!
I opened a case with Seller Support and they just closed it after about 24 hours with no explanation and it now says I cannot reopen the case. I am missing over 1600 sales on my account health and I am concerned that I will imploded by Saturday and get shut down for the 1st time in 14 years of selling.
Any help or suggestions would be great.",Account Health

1000,Account suspended due to having 3 sellers accounts,"Hello, as the title says I made the mistake of opening 3 sellers accounts. My intention was never to sell in all those accounts( I only listed/sold in 1 account).

In June 4 all those account were suspended. I appeal those accounts and the two I never listed anything on were reinstated and I closed them. But the original account is still suspended.

Ive been a full-time seller on Amazon since December 2001 with about 7,500 sales a year. I sell out of print factory sealed and used media and strictly MOSC/MISB toys from the 1980s to the mid 2010s. I received a notification on Thursday that my funds were being held due to 2 authenticity complaints - 1 from February and 1 from last week. I called the number provided in the notification and told them the situation.
I then received an e-mail saying my account is at risk for deactivation. Im being asked to provide a POA with invoices for these 2 specific items that are within 365 days old. I have a POA, but unfortunately the 2 items are from 2005 and 2008 respectively and I cant provide the invoices being requested.

1005,"Critical Event risk of deactivaton, any ideas","Hello fellow sellers, I got this on my account today. Of course right away I checked performance notifications to see if there was anything different, there was not. Two days ago a product I listed was delisted because it contained an ingredient in it which was not approved. Thats happened before, and I closed the listing and deleted it. That has happened enough times over the years that I dont imagine that was the critical issue.
I called seller support, and spoke with someone there who could not identify exactly what was the problem, they just said try to address all issues within performance notifications, which I have. Most of them I have submitted POAs on, and if I couldnt get them reinstated, I closed the listing.
Has anyone else had this before and could give me some insight? I have not had a situation yet where the problem was unidentifiable, and I feel quite a bit of panic just waiting and wondering what will happen. Just to be safe, I have closed every ASIN in question which has had a performance notification. I know there is an automated process where resolution of performance notifications is checked, and I have crossed some ratio threshold. Ive closed all ASIN listings which have had a problem, but I dont know if this counts certainly as a resolution.
I have also messaged Seller Performance preemptively, however I know well that this doesnt necessarily address anything, the review process seems to be very arbitrary. Any insight from anyone who knows would be appreciated.

Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team,
Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to appeal my seller accounts suspension for listing restricted products that are prohibited from sale on Amazon.
What went wrong:
In fact, I did unknowingly list a restricted product. I believe the error occurred in the information I provided when the listing was completed. Furthermore, Ive come to learn that Targus maybe a product that requires additional authorization to sell on your site.
In the future, I plan to avoid this error by making sure to be more careful. If theres any part of the listing that I am not absolutely certain about, Ill be sure to call for further assistance.
The Listing/!ASIN in question:
ASIN: B005L38VT8, SKU: 3R-VBHM-7893, Title: ""Targus Stylus for iPad, iPhone, iPod, Samsung Tablets, Smartphones and Other Touchscreen Devices, Cream (AMM0113US)
This product has been identified as a portable, handheld laser products or related handheld laser product, such as a laser pointer, laser flare, laser pen, laser stylus, pet toy laser, or related product. These products are prohibited for sale or listing on Amazon. For more information, please see the seller Help pages on Laser Pointers and Related Products.
Originally, I recall my
account being deactivated for suspicious activity. The suspicious activity occurred when a family member gained access to my seller account and changed some information. Please be aware , this has since been corrected and rectified to prevent it from happening again. After this occurred, my access was restricted to my seller account.
At the end of last year, I regained access to my seller account,I noticed new performance notifications. Now, the performance notification stated the restriction was for selling restricted products, laser pointers. After researching the Amazon Seller forums on restricted products and how to do plans of appeal, I prepared an appeal to state my case.
Please note, I was given 48 hours to remove the restricted products. However, at the time I was given that opportunity I never realized it. Upon my original account deactivation a few years back, I became discouraged and never appealed that decision, or looked back. Which is why I never noticed the new performance notifications, and missed the 48-hour deadline.
Originally upon recieving the 48 hour notice, I was unable to respond due to being hospitalized. Upon returning to health I discovered the error, but unfortunately it was too late to correct as it was passed as the 48 hours.
Recently, after doing my research on the Amazon Seller forums, I decided to give it another chance and try again to in the beginning I recall myaccount being deactivated for suspicious activity.
At the end of last year, I decided to give selling another shot, I looked into my seller account, and I noticed the newest performance notifications. After researching the Amazon Seller forums on restricted products, and how to do plans of appeal, I prepared an appeal to state my case.
What I have done to fix the issue.
I have carefully reviewed all of Amazons guidelines. Furthermore, to prevent any such violations from occurring in the future, Ive researched information regarding the sale of restricted products, the correct way to aadvertise my products.
Ive educated myself about the products that are prohibited from sale and cant be listed. This includes your Restricted Products policy, including the Examples of Prohibited Listings section. Though its important to point out Ive never missed it a prohibited item, I have educated myself on what those items are to prevent any problems in the future.
The final step Ive taken is to remove all of the listings that were in doubt, and being questioned. In the future, I will double check all of my listings to make sure that the products are described accurately, and are fully compliant with the rules that Amazon has set forth.
sell. Especially, after I realized I was deactivated for what appears to be a huge misunderstanding. Under no certain terms, was I trying to sell a laser pointer, it was a stylus for handheld products.
What I have done to fix the issue.
I believe the error occurred in the listing. In the future to prevent this from happening, if theres anything that Im not absolutely certain about I will call you guys for a clear explanation.

Though its important to point out Ive never missed it a prohibited item, I have educated myself on what those items are to prevent any problems in the future.
Ive gotten myself more accustomed to your listing pages. Ive reviewed their style, questioning, and format I was trying to familiarize myself with these Pages more to insure there are no more innocent misunderstandings about what Im trying to list. Since I believe my problem occurred because of a misinformation in the product listing, I wanted to make sure that didnt happened again. As my account is suspended , this mainly occurred through the that help pages.
The final step Ive taken is to remove all of the listings that were in doubt, and being questioned.
What I will do to prevent this from happening again:
Before listing any new items on Amazon, I will verify that they are permitted for sale, and compliant with Amazon policies and procedures.
To help me ensure that I do not violate any more policies, I will also research whether all of my products are accurately described, and correctly listed in the most informative way for any potential buyers.
I will routinely review Amazons policies to stay aware of any updates, and to monitor changes in regulations. I will review my email daily for any notifications or emails you send out on your policy to stay in tune with whats going on. Also weekly expensive reviews of any uploaded tutorials will be watched and monitoed. These actions will ensure I can immediately take action, and proactively remain compliant with my listings. Any products that I am unable to verify with 100% certainty, will not be listed.
In conclusion , I believe that this plan provides that this issue has been rectified, and Ill prevent it from occurring again. I look forward to having my selling privileges restored. I also look forward to hearing from you! Thanks again for your time!
SIncerely,

1009,Suspended for fair pricing policy but getting illogical replies,"yes I know price-gouging is unprofessional and I shouldnt have done it.
I got a notice saying I would be suspended if I didnt write a good POA within 72hrs. I wrote a POA that amazon deemed worthy except they said I accidentally forgot to lower the price on one of my other Braun thermometers (which was not in the complaint) so they replied saying to actually change that price of that 1x thermometer and just provide more info on how I resolved the problem. I lowered the price on the one thermometer and replied but ever since my initial POA was denied none of Amazons replies have made much sense to me Please see below as I have attached all appeals and denials

 Greater detail on the root cause(s) of the policy violation
 Greater detail on the actions you have taken to resolve policy issues
 Greater detail on the steps you have taken to prevent the policy violation going forward
root cause
I seen other sellers increasing their price on Braun thermometers so I follow their lead and also increased my profit
I though since other sellers on amazon were doing it that it was OK for me to do it but I now know that it is NOT ok. Pricing must match Amazon fair pricing policy and the manufacture asking price (MAP)
I didnt have a good understanding of amazon fair printing policy
I made my pricing way to high which violated amazon fair pricing policy
The actions you have taken to resolve the issue
I have read and understand Amazons fair pricing policies.
I edited all prices to match Amazons fair pricing policy/manufacture asking price. I did this on the ASINs from the complaint, ALL other Braun products/thermometers, and every other item on my inventory page.
After editing prices, I then deleted EVERY Braun product from my inventory including the ASINs from the complaint.
I have NEVER violated Amazons fair pricing policy in the many years of my Amazon selling EXCEPT with these Braun thermometers, and I felt safest by permanently removing them from my inventory and never offering them for sale again.
how to prevent in future
I will always check and use the MAP when I create new listings to ensure my listings dont violate amazon fair pricing policy
I went through my entire inventory page and adjusted/made sure my pricing was matching the MAP
I will continue to read amazon fair pricing policy any time there are changes/updates to the policy
I will never change prices because other sellers are doing so nor will I do it just to make extra money. I will strictly follow the MAP always to make sure I never violate amazon fair pricing policy
my first appeal was denied, but they only wanted me to fix the 1x price and address the 1x issue on my POA

GREATER DETAIL ON ROOT CAUSE OF THE GOUGING
I increased my prices on the items from the complaint way to high simply to make more profit, because I had seen other Amazon sellers doing it too. I shouldve never gone past the MSRP, because that caused me to violate Amazon policy and get suspended.
I failed to read Amazons fair pricing policy guidelines and applicable laws regarding the pricing of items on Amazons marketplace.
GREATER DETAIL ON THE ACTIONS I HAVE TAKEN TO RESOLVE THE COMPLAINT
I have deleted all the ASINs in the complaint from my inventory, and I have also deleted EVERY OTHER Braun product.
I have gone through my entire inventory page and made sure NONE of my listings violate MSRP / Amazons fair pricing policy
GREATER DETAIL ON STEPS I HAVE TAKEN TO PREVENT PRICE GOUGING IN THE FUTURE
I will never offer ANY Braun products for sale again. In my many years of selling on Amazon I have never violated MSRP/Amazon fair pricing policy except with these Braun products. I prefer to never offer them for sale again to ensure that I dont get in future trouble.
Any time I add inventory I will make sure that my price matches the MSRP to be certain that I am not violating Amazon fair pricing policy
I will be checking my inventory pricing weekly to ensure my prices match MSRP and dont violate Amazons fair pricing policy.
If I cannot locate the manufacture suggested retail price for an item, then that item will not be listed for sale by me.
I will make sure to regularly check Amazon policies for updates and changes to any policies so that I can take immediate action and remove any noncompliant listings.
I have never been in trouble for violating pricing policies and I promise it will never happen again. Sorry for the trouble, and thank you for your time.

We will continue to monitor our prices daily to be certain that we dont violate pricing policies.
We will be sure to stay up to date & in compliance with Amazons fair pricing policy in case any changes occur to the policy.

-ANYWAYS. its like each message their verbiage is changing. first they say I violated FAIR PRICING policy and I just needed to address the 1x issue. Then they say I violated by price GOUGING and I need to address ALL 3x topics of my POA again. Now theyre saying I violated multipack pricing and need to address all 3x issues.
-Although I dont even sell multipack items, and anything that they MAY TRY to consider a multipack is not more expensive than the items are when sold individually (which is what violating multipack pricing is defined as)
-Also after I was told my POA wasnt implemented I went through my inventory and deleted all items that I no longer sell. I had over 2000x ASINs but now I only have 192x ASINs. After I deleted all the ASINs I went through every single item to ensure pricing was fair.
I just feel like every time I send an appeal I get some confusing message back. Im soooo tempted to message jeff@amazon but I know that should be last resort. Im hoping somebody here can give me some advice before I resort to messaging Jeff

Ive put Second appeal below in bold if you want to skip down to that section directly. Above that Ive pasted the communication so far between us and Amazon.
We combined a few dozen similar SKUs into child-parent listings over a period of 3 days. On the 3rd day, we got this email:
Hello,
Your Amazon selling account has been deactivated. Your listings have been removed. Funds will not be transferred to you and may be held for up to 90 days. Please ship any open orders to avoid further impact to your account.

Our appeal: (Sent using the appeal form provided by Amazon, so its pretty basic.)
The root cause of the issue
Variations were created by organizing ASINs into parent - child relationships. Many of these listings were combined in ways that do not adhere to Amazon policies. We were not aware of the rules regarding combining ASINs under parent listings.
The actions you have taken to resolve the issue
We have removed these parent - child relationships and split variations into separate listings to return them to a state which adheres to Amazon policies.
The steps you have taken to prevent the issue going forward
We have reviewed various sources of information to ensure future listing changes are in line with Amazon policies. These sources of information include:
Amazon help documents and tutorials
Amazon seller central forum posts on the subject of combining listings in parent - child relationships
Consulting with veteran Amazon sellers in our business network
Future edits to Amazon listings will only take place once these sources have been reviewed and we are confident that parent - child relationships can be created 100% within Amazon policies.
In addition, employee training is being planned to ensure the employees with seller central sub accounts are aware of Amazon rules for combining listings, to ensure no accidental changes to listings are made that do not conform to Amazon standards and policies.
Amazons reply is below.
Hello,
We reviewed your account and the information you provided, and we have decided that you may not sell on Amazon.com.
Why did this happen?
Sellers on Amazon.com are not allowed to create listings that violate Amazon selling policies.
Second appeal
Based on the advice given in the other thread, as well as help weve had from elsewhere, weve written a second appeal:
Hello Amazon,
Our account was deactivated due to incorrect use of listing variations. We have taken a series of actions that correct our mistakes and we have put in place measures to prevent further such mistakes. Please review our plan of action below.
The root cause of the issue
Our original understanding of Amazon policy regarding creation of variations was based on the first section of the Variation Relationship Overview: https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G8831
In this document, variation relationships are described as follows: Good variation relationship listings allow buyers to compare and choose products based on different attributes such as size, color, or other characteristics
Based on this overview, we created variations which we believed fit the intent behind variations, which we believed was primarily to let customers compare and choose similar products which they would naturally expect to find together on one page, on the basis of small variations in product features.
Before the issue occured, our SKUs were arranged in separate listings, which we believed was described in the Variation Relationships Overview as something to avoid: Rather than a cluttered view of all possible color and size combinations, the customer can select the preferred size, and choose the color We believed the other characteristics mentioned in the Variation Relationship Overview document applied to the characteristics of our products.
Based on this logic, we therefore decided to organize various similar products into variations. We sell a large number of SKUs on Amazon, so in total roughly 30 SKUs were combined as child variations under new parent ASINs. Here are two example cases that are representative of the numerous variation relationships we created:
Case 1 - Our Parent ASIN B089KBB66M and Child ASINs B00UIFSW4I B00R5Z9J9Q B01720MKV2 B01720MKV2 B0868SS5PX B00R5Z9J9Q are all j5create brand hard drive enclosures with the same function and minor feature variations - we believed customers may naturally expect to see these listed together so they can make an easy choice among well organized SKUs. However, this is incorrect use of variations for this categoryonly variations of color and size may be created.
Case 2 - Our Parent ASIN B089LTBDC5 and Child ASINs B01FI7PEH8 B071K9GLC8 B01AUWG31M B01AUWG31M B088TKV9SQ are all j5create brand USB-C hubs with the same basic function and purpose, but with different numbers of ports and ports of varying functionality. Combining these ASINs as variations is incorrect use of variation relationships for this categoryonly variations of color and size may be created.
We took these actions based on an incomplete understanding of Amazon listing policy. After a deep review of Amazons Listing Policy, we have identified the following key mistakes:
We mis-used variations and created variation relationships that were not appropriate for the product category, thereby violating the Amazon Listing Policy:
By using variation themes incorrectly. As the Best Practices on Variation Relationship Review stated: A color and size variation theme must not include any information other than color and size respectively.
We made changes too quickly, leading to a situation where a large number of new variation relationships were created between June 2 and June 6, and two Amazon policy warnings were sent June 6, followed by a suspension notification also sent June 6. Because we make changes too quickly, we did not have time to react to Amazons warnings. We failed to respond to the policy warning message dated June, 6 2020 immediately and did not make a prompt corrective action.
Actions immediately completed to resolve the situation
We have removed all variations that were in violation of Amazon policy
We have removed these parent - child relationships and split variations into separate listings to return them to a state which adheres to Amazon policies. We have verified that all our listings currently adhere to Amazon Variation Listing policies by taking specific actions mentioned in the following paragraphs.
In order to be sure our current listings are now in adherence with Amazon policy, we have carefully reviewed Amazon help documents related to ASIN creation and management:
Variation Relationship Overview https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G8831
Variation Relationship FAQ https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G201951410
ASIN Creation Policy https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G201844590
The key finding from these documents is that for the categories we are selling in, variations may only be created for size and color.
After reviewing the above help documents, we checked our listings to ensure that none were violating any of the Amazon policies related to them. To the best of our knowledge, we currently have no listings that violate Amazon policies. No variation relationships currently exist that fall outside the scope of size and color.
To ensure our understanding of Amazon variation policies is now correct, we reviewed Amazon seller central forum posts on this subject to see examples from other sellers on how to combine listings in parent - child relationships. We also consulted with other veteran Amazon sellers in our business network to discuss these policies, ensuring that our understanding of them is correct and as complete as possible.
Future process changes to ensure this doesnt happen again
We have arranged staff training to review Amazon Policy closely and ensure all employees with Amazon account access understand the policies before any changes to listings are made. These training seminars will be held at our office in the next few days. This training is primarily focused on ensuring all employees with ASIN creation and management permissions understand that variations may only be used to combine the same product with either color or size variations, and variations are not to be used for any other purpose.
We have updated our training procedures and documents for new staff onboarding to ensure that the topic of variation creation and management is covered in detail using the latest Amazon help documents and policies. New employees will receive clear and thorough training, and show they understand these rules, before they are given permission to use our Amazon seller account.
We have created a company policy requiring any creation or alteration of ASINs and variations be reviewed by senior staff for approval prior to enactment to ensure adherence to Amazon policies.
We have created a company policy that requires employees to consult with Amazon Seller Support and our seller network with specific questions before making changes that we may be uncertain about. Future edits to Amazon listings where any uncertainty exists, for example for products in categories we have not sold in previously, will only take place once these sources have been consulted.
We have created a company policy to only change 1 parent-children family of variation relationships per week. We will make changes slowly and methodically, with checks and verification by senior staff to ensure all policies are followed and that we have time to react to any Amazon performance notifications in the unlikely event that problems might arise. Using a slower pace, we will have time to ensure any further policy warning messages will be resolved promptly, to ensure swift adherence to Amazons policies.
Going forward we have implemented business operational changes at our company including full staff training, review of all details listed on Amazon Policy, and ensure 100% adherence to Amazon listing policies going forward.
We have set company policies that require employees with Amazon account access to regularly review and monitor any changes in Amazon policy relating to ASIN creation, variation relationship management, and other listing related policies.
We acknowledge we made a mistake by violating Amazons Variation Policy. We are now fully up to speed on the details of Amazons Variation Listing Policy and will 100% adhere going forward to ensure no out of policy changes are made. We ask for forbearance and for a reinstatement of our selling account.

We knew this would be happening and despite the new terms that allow it, we still made sure to get written permission from Amazon in advance to ensure it wouldnt affect our main account.
After opening the new account, it was immediately suspended for further verification (utility bill, etc). When this happened, our main account also got suspended as a related account under the rule that accounts that are related to suspended accounts also get suspended.
It took a couple of weeks but the new account was eventually verified and allowed to sell. However, the main account was not reactivated. We submitted the appeal to let them know the new account is verified. It has been over three weeks with no response, and exactly one month since the suspension started. Our funds and inventory are being held, and we are being charged storage fees.
Today we received a notification that we have 30 days to create removal orders for our inventory or it will be disposed of. If we remove all inventory, we will have incurred fees shipping to Amazon shipping back from Amazon, and then shipping to Amazon when we are allowed to send the inventory to them again.

 Amazon Name: F** *******S
A month ago I was able to establish my US based company (H*** *** ***** LLC) in order to sell my products through this company in the US, for this reason I contacted Amazon seller performance team to transfer the ownership of the account, they denied my request and recommended to open a new account:
Account No. 2

1019,90 days post appeal,"My account was shut down due to a counterfeit strike. I was selling aftermarket car parts (with the motors business authorizations necessary to sell on Amazon).
I am a dropship company (which to elaborate means I buy the products after the customer buys it then ship direct to the customer). Therefore I did not have an invoice dated prior to the point of purchase. I instead have a dealer account with this company. I had sent my dealer account activation emails, purchase orders and receipts.
This wasnt enough information.
I called my supplier and had them make me a certificate of authorization to present to the account health team. This was not enough information.
I took down all the products and my account even says there are no more policy violations.
I called and spoke to several representatives who told me it was common and shouldnt be a problem to fix. I followed their advice (I took notes) and it wasnt enough.
I gave the Account Health team the phone number to the brand in question to ask about verifying me they never called. I had the brand email Amazon, and they didnt care. It was never enough.

1020,Account DEACTIVATED; related to another seller account,"Hi everyone,
Today I received the dreaded notification that my account had been deactivated. I have a 5 or 6 year old selling account with zero blemishes and in otherwise perfect standing.
Reason: relation to another selling account.
I am not a duplicate account or in any conjunction with any other selling account. What is likely the root of the issue (if this is not in complete error), is that I, while living at home as a teenager a decade ago, operated my own BUYING account under the same roof as my parents who sold/sell on Amazon, and only many years after moving out on my own (to another state completely), registered to sell for myself. All of the documentation Amazon has ever received from me, including forms like the Tax Interview, very much prove that I live and operate independently, a thousand miles away, with zero ties to that household. Additionally, we do not and have not ever sold identical products. There are ZERO fathomable ties other than the same last name and that household being an old Ship-To address on my buyer account when I order something.
This is the full story here (I say that because as an avid reader of the forums, I know the OP doesnt always tell it), and to the best Im aware, none of this is in violation of policy. I would love to hear any input and how this should be best addressed/appealed. Is this best to tackle as a deactivation in error (and how?), or am I guilty of a bigger infraction that I need to cop to?

1021,Pls help! My accout got suspended because of misused ASIN variation,"Is anybody can help us check the POA? We received the notification last Thursday. Thanks.
Reason 1, we are a professional manufacturer in this industry, so we mistakenly thought that the Amazon variation principle was the same as ours;
Reason 2, we referred to other sellers specialized in this industry, so we copied their variation method. But its wrong way.
The true reason is that we did not completely understand and master Amazons variation policy.
The 2 policies we frequently violated were ""Adding products that are newer versions or models of the parent ASIN and ""Adding products images and/or names that are that are fundamentally different from the parent ASIN.
 Parent ASIN: B088GY74D7
Child ASIN: B0881SMJL4,B0881THBW4,B0881THTGF
The above child ASINs were upgraded version 2.0 to previous ones, but we thought they could be added in the same parent ASIN as the version 1.4. it violated the policy""Adding products that are newer versions or models of the parent ASIN
 Parent ASIN: B088GN1ML1
Child ASIN: B0881SFZMN, B0881SJKTR, B0881TN9WQ
B0881SFZMN and B0881TN9WQ is VGA switch 2 port and 4 ports, while B0881SJKTR is VGA switch 8 ports , its size is bigger, image, function and price are different. It violated ""Adding products images and/or names that are that are fundamentally different from the parent ASIN.
 Parent ASIN : B07Y4NRNKB
Child ASIN: B07T54XD8Y, B07TX8HFFS, B07TY9WFYH,B088FJBVT9
They are converters, but obviously they are quite different from look and function. Therefore they could not be in the same parent ASIN. It violated ""Adding products images and/or names that are that are fundamentally different from the parent ASIN.
Action
In the past 4 days, we organized all the staff and fully studied Amazons policy like ASIN creation limit, Variation Policy and Duplicate ASIN creation policy. Meanwhile, we applied this policies to our ASINs, analyzed and compared them 1 by 1, especially about the policy of products images and/or names that are that are fundamentally different from the parent ASIN and newer versions or models policy.
We have checked all parent ASINs and child ASINs, removed or deleted all ASINs that violated the variation policy. see the attached
POA
We have organized our team to completely study the Amazon variation policy, and had trained our associates about it, particularly with emphasis on variation policy of new version and different look.
We have deeply realized that even the same series of products in the company, if they are fundamentally different in look, function, material or version, we can not add them in the same parent ASIN. In future, we will keep training on the variation policy once a week.
In order to prevent adding the new version model or model with fundamental difference to the previous parent ASIN, we only allow the experienced specialist to edit ASIN or variation. Then we will check and analyze the new variations to make sure its complied with the Amazons policy, like child ASINs specifics, look, function, material, version, size, title, imagesetc
At the same time, we will also visit seller forum to discuss with other sellers when in doubt. if this way cant fix it, we will use contact seller support to get the final approval, instead of referring to the ways other similar sellers use
whats more, we will never add new child ASINs to old parent ASIN in case that the same problem happens again.",Account Health

1023,Account Deactivated Due to Used Sold As New,"Our account was deactivated on May 11, when we submitted a PoA to Amazon. We submitted the Plan on a Friday and on that following Monday, we received an email stating that they had not received anything from us, so they deactivated our account. When I called Amazon Account Health, I was told that they did receive my submission and that it was under review. I was very confused as to why our account had been deactivated, but I was told that there was nothing that could be done but to submit a successful Plan of Action. We have been working on that since then and the last PoA we submitted was on May 21. After waiting for almost two weeks, we finally heard something back from Amazon. We are very hopeful that we can put this behind us soon and get our account reactivated, but I wanted to stop here and ask for some advice first.

Im considering scrapping everything below and just starting over. We greatly appreciate anything that is contributed. We have been dealing with this for over a month now with almost daily conversations with Amazons Account Health Support Team.
This time they have requested:
We received your submission, but you have not sent us sufficient information to address the complaints we received that your items appear to be used.
Please send an updated plan of action that contains:
Greater detail on the steps that you have taken to prevent future complaints about the condition of your items.
This is what we had sent in previously (bear with me - its quite lengthy):
""We have several measures in place to prevent complaints in the future. We have closed the listings for all ASINs listed under the Product Condition Customer complaints of the Account Health dashboard and we will no longer sell these items when our account is reinstated. We have disposed of anything that could be considered used. Our company will continue to only buy products directly from the manufacturing companies. If we sell Florsheim, we order directly from Weyco Group, Inc., as that is the manufacturing company for that brand. If we sell Myra bags, we buy from Khemchand Handicraft, Inc., as that is the manufacturing facility for Myra bags. We will continue to always ship items in their original packaging, with additional protective packaging if needed. We will also continue to inspect each item that we receive from the manufacturers in order to ensure complete customer satisfaction. We will maintain our routine to inspect every item them we get back from Amazon FBA to make sure that we are not receiving damaged items back into our system and inventory. In fact, we have implemented a few changes to our inspection/shipping process to help with this type of situation. It is as follows:
When the item is received, it is looked over by our receiving team. The items are unboxed in our freight room and we check each item for correct sizes, correct colors, manufacturer defects, damages that could have occurred during shipping from the manufacturing facility, and matching product descriptions on the box.
The item is then added into our personal store inventory. After adding our own tags and scanning the UPCs into our system, it is then stored in our warehouse, sorted by brand and gender.
When we receive an order for an item, it is pulled from our warehouse. The item is brought to our online orders clerk. From there, it is matched to a receipt, if it is being fulfilled by the merchant. If it is being shipped FBA, it is brought to our FBA clerk. The item is then inspected again to check for correct sizes, correct colors, manufacturer defects, matching product descriptions on the box, and damages that could result from sitting in the warehouse.
The item is then transferred to our shipping clerk or our FBA clerk who packages and ships the item. Depending on the item, they are packaged as follows:
o If we are shipping household items, the item is first wrapped in bubble wrap. It is then placed inside a box and covered with peanuts. This prevents the item from moving too much and breaking during shipment. Fragile items are marked with a fragile sticker on each side of the box to assure gentle handling.
o If we are shipping clothing or accessories, the item is placed in a clear bag with a suffocation warning printed on it and sealed. This prevents any dirt and grime that enters during transportation from damaging the cloth material. It is then placed in either a box or a poly-mailer depending on size.
o If we are packaging shoes, we make sure that the protective paper in the shoe box is correctly wrapped around the shoes. The item is then placed in a box not much bigger than the shoes box. This prevents the item from moving too much in the shipping box and damaging the shoes box. If it moves, the shipping box is stuffed with packing paper, peanuts, or bubble wrap in order to prevent further movement.
The box is then taped shut along every edge of all four flaps (top and bottom) and set aside to await pickup from the corresponding shipping company. This helps prevent dust and debris from entering the box and damaging the items. This also prevents tearing of the box and other damage during transit to the customer.
Once the customer receives their item or when an item is sent back to FBA, we send out a proactive feedback request. We have a program that automatically sends out a message to the customer thanking them for their purchase and asking if there was anything we can improve on. Any information that they can provide is helpful in making the experience for the next customer better. Any time that a customer reports a defective or damaged item, we create a removal order for that item and temporarily deactivate the listing to guarantee that the product is inspected and disposed of properly.
Even with all of the detail that goes in to the inspection process, items tend to slip through and get shipped to customers. That is why we will also begin to inspect our inventory regularly every six months when we do our physical inventory scan. The items will be inspected for each of the points mentioned in the inspection process above - correct sizes, correct colors, manufacturer defects, matching product descriptions on the box, and damages that could result from sitting in the warehouse.
This new process will help us to avoid future customer complaints. We will continue to duly inspect every item before it leaves our doors and to do everything within our power in order to ensure complete customer satisfaction, both through Amazon fulfillment and merchant fulfillment.""

Taking full responsibility for the action
Removing all games in question from our inventory
Becoming a registered LLC with the state
Changing our business practices
Seller Health Reps said that we have a strong POA, but it was still suspended.
PLEASE HELP!!
Here is our Appeal from May 27th (We were just denied for the 12th time):
I am the principal of MY COMPANY, and I am writing to appeal the suspension of our seller account due to complaints about product authenticity concerning ASIN B001O1OBFY. We understand that Amazon takes these complaints seriously so we have thoroughly examined our account to determine the root cause of the issue and implemented appropriate remedies.
ROOT CAUSE
 First off, I would like to state that this whole situation involving ASIN is a mistake on our part (______________) to fail to verify an authorized supplier (OUR OLD SUPPLIER) and also continually use them for purchasing inventory to sell on Amazon.com. We did not know that ASIN B001O1OBFY was discontinued from being manufactured by the Nintendo company. If we had known this information prior to purchasing the product from (OUR OLD SUPPLIER), we would not have gone through with placing any orders from any suppliers and with selling the inventory on Amazon.com.
 The product page did not include information about the incompatibility of the Pokmon Platinum and certain game accessories. Therefore, customers thought they received an inauthentic product when their Pokmon Bank and/or Poke Transporter did not work with this game. You can check this information on the Nintendo website using this link: (https://bit.ly/2xPX3Nv).
 Additionally, the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service was discontinued for the Pokmon Platinum version since May 20, 2014. This means it is no longer possible to use online features of Nintendo DS/DSi and Wii software such as online play, matchmaking, competitions, and leaderboards for this version. You can read more about this using the link below: (https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-DS/Pokemon-Platinum-Version-272321.html)
 This information is also not included in the product description. Therefore, customers who were unaware of this update thought our product was inauthentic because the online features for this product were no longer available.
 We only realized the importance of both these disclosures after our account had been suspended so we are unable to make the necessary changes to the listing.
 Furthermore, we are unable to provide proof that the products we sold were authentic because we purchased the Pokmon Platinum video game from an e-commerce store (OUR OLD SUPPLIERS WEBSITE) that is not an authorized distributor of Nintendo products and does not provide invoices.
 We were unaware that (OUR OLD SUPPLIER) was not an unauthorized distributor of Nintendo products because we did not properly vet our suppliers before ordering products from them.
 We were also unaware of Amazons requirement to present a valid invoice whenever requested so when we purchased these products from (OUR OLD SUPPLIER), we thought printing the order details from our online account would be sufficient in lieu of an invoice. But Seller Performance has rejected these documents every time we submitted it.
 Therefore, when we received multiple complaints that the product was inauthentic, we had no document to prove its authenticity.
ACTIONS TAKEN TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE
 At the time our account was suspended, we had sold all our Nintendo game products sourced from (OUR OLD SUPPLIER) and did not have any inventory left at FBA, so we deleted our listing for the Pokmon Platinum game and all other Nintendo game products from our account.
 We ceased all business with (OUR OLD SUPPLIER) and will not source from this supplier again.
 We searched for authorized wholesale distributors of Nintendo products online and found Ingram Entertainment. On their homepage, we were able to confirm that they are an authorized distributor of Nintendo products. (https://www.ingramentertainment.com/)
 When we attempted to order the Pokmon Platinum game from Ingram Entertainment, we were informed that this version is no longer available for sale in new condition. You can confirm this by visiting the Nintendo website at www.nintendo.com and entering Pokmon Platinum on the search engine. You wont find this product anymore.
 In lieu of the Pokmon Platinum version (which is no longer available for sale in new condition), we purchased 10 units of the Nintendos Rock Revolution because it is also a Nintendo game and highly recommended by our new supplier. See attached copy of our packing slip invoice from this new supplier.
STEPS TO PREVENT THE ISSUE GOING FORWARD
 We designated a trained senior staff member to sign off on our product description content to ensure that our product pages contain all information about the product to keep customers well informed and set proper expectations for their purchase.
 We have implemented a new rule for our company that requires us to make sure a product is still being manufactured and has not been discontinued. We can do this by calling authorized suppliers and checking to verify this information.
 We assigned a trained staff member to vet all potential suppliers before we order any product from them. The vetting process includes the steps below. This vetting process will prevent inauthentic product complaints in the future.
 Firstly, checking to make sure they are able to provide invoices that meet Amazons requirements. We do this by asking the supplier to provide a sample of the invoices that they issue.
 Secondly, verifying if they are an authorized distributor of the products they sell. We do this by checking their website and/or asking the supplier to issue a licensing agreement from the brand owner or asking them to issue a written statement declaring that they are indeed an authorized distributor of a particular product.
 Because our account is suspended, we are unable to make changes to any listing at this time. Once we get access to our account again, we will create a case to suggest that the disclosure below be added to the product description for ASIN B001O1OBFY. This will keep customers well informed and set proper expectations for their purchase.
 Compatibility: Pokmon Platinum is not compatible with the Pokmon Bank and Poke Transporter game accessories.
 Important Note: The Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service was discontinued for the Pokmon Platinum version since May 20, 2014. This means it is no longer possible to use online features of Nintendo DS/DSi and Wii software such as online play, matchmaking, competitions, and leaderboards for this version.
 Together with our staff, we read and reviewed Amazons policy on Product Authenticity and Quality, the Anti-Counterfeiting Policy and Intellectual Property Policy for Sellers.

Someone please help, I am losing out on a ton of sales the past 3 1/2 months and dont know what Seller Performance wants from me.

1028,Why cant a negative feedback that is obvioulsy false be appealed?,"I got a negative feedback stating no where did the listing state the item was used. However, my current listing, and record of the sale both state Used, Like New - Open package.
Why should I catch a negative feedback and have my account jeopardized (Im a small volume seller) for Amazons user experience not clearly indicating enough to the user the condition of the item? Why cant this be appealed when theres obvious proof?

1029,Funds Reserved 110 days due to IP Issue. Complaint Retracted 6 Weeks Ago. Notice-Dispute keeps telling to wait !?!,"I got performance notification on February 28th saying that your disbursements from your seller account have been placed on hold. This due to intellectual property issue.
To resolve this dispute, we suggest that you contact the rights owner directly:
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
If you resolve this matter with the rights owner, please advise them to contact us at notice-dispute to withdraw their complaint.
Only one ASIN that found infringing (self fulfilled), i immediately deleted that listing but Amazon put a hold on all my money. The fund withholding goes up to $200,000 now because my FBA items got sold everyday.
I did hired an attorney to deal with the issue and the rights owner withdraw complaint 6 weeks ago.
I emailed notice-dispute first they told me to wait and they will come back if any updates available. No updates until today.
I emailed payments-funds because i found that if the funds reserved over 90 days they will conduct a separate investigation. Then the case being transferred and no responses at all.
My attorney said Amazon is behind in all cases. And we just keep waiting not being able to do anything. Waiting after 6 weeks of complaint retraction is insane!!
If Amazon doesnt do anything and keep my money for this long, can i hire an attorney to file a motion with the court forcing the issue?
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",Account Health
1030,Help with the appeal,"Dear Seller Performance Team .
Thank you for taking the time to read my appeal. I am Ruben Axxx the owner of Xxxxx , a company that is selling on amazon, and I am writing in response to our account suspension, with a plan of action to address our recent deactivation due to Product Authenticity issues.
We understand that we have come in contravention of Amazons policies. We first of all would like to apologize, and stress that we are determined to make sure this does not happen again. Following the complaint, we have put a number of procedures in place to ensure that we will not get any future infringement.
I would like to address the violations that have led to my suspension which I believe are as follows:
1. The ASINS B088WSCcxxx , B088WVxxx and B0893NHxxx , not had being authentic. This was due our inexperience and immature in selling on Amazon, and we do not conduct the proper vigilance when choosing a supplier.
2. Contravention of Amazons  Prohibited Seller Activities and Actions Policy and 'Anti-Counterfeiting Policy '.
3. other violation was Not ensuring that the supplier was licensed by the brand owner.
4. Dont act in a reasonable timeline to stop show the listings with this irregularity of authenticity.
5. The little knowledge when listing a product was another cause for the problem, we listed those products with a brand that is already sold in other popular markets, and we made the mistake of listing showing the brand thinking that we would capture sales. what we now know was a bad decision on our part.
6. We do not precede constantly checking our listings to find or prevent failures
7. Unfortunately, we do not have invoices to check the products mentioned because we were going to do a drop shipping.
I also think that the problem that led to the closure of my account could be my way of wanting to sell on Amazon because I wanted to make my sale through third party companies such as Walmart, Target, eBay and others,
I want to add that due to the covid-19, Walmart did not send me an initial stock that I wanted to have at my company address. (attached refund image) in April.
For this reason, I thought about sending my customers through Walmart as a third party the products, so after that I decided to list and show the brand of the product because this product is sold at Walmart .
We were new to the amazon platform and to this business. We know that this whole situation is our fault and irresponsibility, for not put more attention and taking measures to avoid problems like these, due to our lack of experience we do not take into consideration Amazons specific parameters when listing products, stocks and policies.
Immediate corrective actions:
1. The listings which received complaints have been deleted permanently and will not be reactivated.
2. Removal order for these ASINS have been created on 05/25/2020 (remove and delete ASINS B088WSCxxx , B088WVFxx and B0893NHxx ). The remaining stock has been destroyed.
3. Most of our other listings have also been checked and deleted. they will not be showed until their authenticity can be proven through verifying reliability of suppliers and contacting brand owners
4. I have reviewed the Amazon Policies and agreements (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/201165970 2 , https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html?itemID=G201808410&language=en_US&ref=id_G201808410_cont_521&ref_=xx_swlang_head_help&mons_sel_locale=es_ES&languageSwitched=1 4, https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html?itemID=G201361070&language=en_US&ref=id_G201361070_cont_521 2), playing dose attention to Prohibited Seller Activities and Actions Policy and Anti-Counterfeiting Policy and I am sure that I will go to follow them strictly.
Long Term Corrective Actions :
1. All inventory will be sourced by contacting the brand owner directly in order to find verified suppliers, or directly from the manufacturer.
2. To get invoices or letter from our suppliers and in this way have more confident in the products and quality of them.
3. We are going to ask for letters of commitment from our suppliers where they agree to send good quality, permitted products.
4. try to physically or digitally verify the facilities where our products are stored or produced.
5. In future, purchases will not be made from retailers unless I can verify with the brand owner that they are authentic products.
6. All orders received will be thoroughly inspected for authenticity and fully match the description and other details on the Amazon product page.
7. All sales and message procedures will be answered daily from 11am to 6pm.
8. Any dissatisfaction of the client will be inspected and evaluated immediately giving way to a refund or exchange of product and the withdrawn product will be examined when it returns to our warehouse.
9. All orders received from our suppliers will be thoroughly inspected on receipt and again on compliance to ensure that our products maintain the high-quality standard that Amazon requires.
10. Also, for us we DO NOT have future inconveniences and setbacks and we have decided to send the products directly to the wineries of amazon so that the existence and quality of the product can be verified by amazon.
11. We want to emphasize that we understand that Amazon extremely values the customer and the customers satisfaction. We would also like to emphasize and add that we are very determined to continue selling on the Amazon platform, and we hope that as a relatively new and inexperienced seller this could be considered a mistake. We hope that Amazon can forgive these errors that unfortunately got out of hand this occasion.
Please let us know if there is anything else, we can do to reinstate our selling privileges.
Thank you for working with us to resolve these issues.

1032,Suspended for related account after selling since 2006,"Hi everyone.
Remember old Amazon Marketplace? The one before Seller Central I do, but Amazon apparently does not.
When they opened Seller Central, Seller Support instructed me to open a new seller account on Seller Central so I could continue selling Music CDs and DVDs, and also refer customers to my feedback in the Marketplace account.
Up until 2016, I had been running both accounts assuming that Amazon, by specifically instructing me to open the new account, gave permission to keep using both due to their system limitations at the time of transition. I had also been gradually transferring all my inventory to the Seller Central account. In 2016, that transition was complete on my end, and I deactivated the old account by putting it on a permanent vacation mode.
I am assuming now it was my mistake to rely on Amazon keeping records of the permission they granted, while also failing to explicitly close the old account.
I completely stopped using the old account in 2016 and have not had a single sale there since.
In 2016, Amazon emailed me a warning about multiple accounts, to which I responded with all the above information, and that seemed to have satisfied them since there were no more questions then. I told them I had permission to operate two accounts and they seemed to agree with it.
Fast forward to June 4, 2020 Both my old and current accounts get suspended for related accounts violation. My current account gets this:
We found that your current selling account is related to a different selling account which violated our policies and is not allowed to sell on our site. As a result, you may no longer use the current selling account to sell on Amazon.com.
My old account gets:
We found that your account is related to an account that may not be used to sell on our site. As a result, you may no longer sell on Amazon.com.
I do not sell internationally, but my empty Canada account (no inventory) is also suspended, but there are no performance notifications.
I have submitted an appeal to both old and new account and both got rejected.
I am completely confused as to what to do next. I am confused about which account they consider the offending one and which needs to be appealed first.

1038,Listing blocked due to a complaint that the buyer confirmed was filed for a wrong order,"Hey everyone,
We have a listing that sold a plenty of units with no issues/returns.
One (apparently elderly) buyer called Amazon to request (the first ever for this product) return with reason Product damaged, but box okay - we authorized instantly and supplied prepaid label.
Next day the listing was deactivated for used sold as new complaint
Several days later the buyer contacted us apologizing and saying that she noticed the return was requested with the wrong reason:
the order was mixed up with a different one and the item has never been opened or taken out of the shipping box but needs to be returned due to project being cancelled.
Okay, no worries, mistakes happen. We even waived restocking and shipping fees to reward honesty.
The customer even called Amz to let them know that there is no issue with the order and the item is in perfect condition (reference messaged by a customer support rep).
Now to the funny part. I wrote the POA describing the situation and quoting the messages history with the buyer. It was declined. The Amz reply referenced the exact order number as the source of the complaint
How do I answer the question what caused the complaint with anything other than the buyer reported the wrong order because they (or the Amz rep) got confused inside their account, if this is exactly what happened?
Having to explain what you did wrong and how you will do better when you did nothing wrong and the buyer confirms just blows my mind. Do I need to make up a bunch of self incriminating B-S because what happened does not fit in with presumption of guilt?
The logic is broken here

Dear Seller Performance Team,
Please find below our detailed plan of action for your review.
Merchant Token [**************************]
Our Canada seller account has been suspended due to issues related to intellectual property infringement. We understand that Amazon prohibits the listing of products that violate brand ownership and we take full responsibility for the claims that we have received.
The complaints are in relation to the following ASINs:
ASIN: B07PSH8Y68, B07WH6V7CG, B0819VB7FM, B07PHK2SHG, B07G72LHPQ, B07PQ71FR1
The root cause of the suspension -
Our seller account has been suspended due to issues related to intellectual property infringement. We understand that Amazon prohibits the listing of products that violate intellectual ownership of a trademark owner and take full responsibility for the claims that we have received and that some of our listings have trademark infringement.
Please find below how our listing products are identified and purchased:
The products to be listed are identified by our Online Sales Department using softwares.
Purchasing team finds suppliers for these products and manages the procurement.
Please note that our products are procured from different countries and regions. In that case, the products who are subject to the suspension have been identified by the software and imported from China. Unfortunately, we couldnt realize that these products can be a subject of infringement until Amazons notice. On the other hand, we tried to reach our suppliers asking for the letter of authorizations and the invoices but we were confronted with serious delays in communication due to the virus outbreak. We finally got in contact with them and please find the related document on the attachment.
In that case, we noticed that the causes of the infringement are
The softwares we are using to identify products to be listed and to check the current listings in compliance with Amazon Policies are not successful enough to determine all the intellectual property infringement.
We recognized that our sales and procurement teams need more training about Canadian Intellectual Property Rules and Amazon IP Policies.
Our system is not obliging our warehouse staff to do a visual inspection of the products before the shipment in case of an infringement.
We dont have an Emergency Contact List of our suppliers, our key people and other business partners.

And sometimes I got We received your submission but do not have enough information to reactivate your account at this time. We cannot accept this invoice because we are unable to verify the supplier.
I have submitted all invoices with supplier information for the last 365 days sales. when I see amazon cant verify my supplier then I am working with my supplier and collect my supplier invoice. I also submitted my supplier backup invoices which are directly purchased from manufacturer and distributor. I also mention in my POA if amazon can not verify this supplier then next time we do not a business with this supplier and source our item from a different supplier or try to purchase directly from distributors.
Need help what should i do?
I understand that amazon takes inauthentic complaint very seriously and I would like to share my plan of action in which I explain what I have done to resolve the issue and what will I do to prevent it from happening again.
What went wrong
 Over the past few months multiple customers expressed concerns regarding the authenticity of their products they purchase from us we failed to solve their issue in a professional and timely manner
 Another issue is whether, because perfume is an alcoholic product which can be affected by temperature, it can happen if the product stays a couple of days in customers mailbox which is mostly situated in an open-air environment
 The customer might be receiving an item that was not in an acceptable condition.
 The product was might not be packaged in protective packaging, which would protect it against damage during shipping.
What I have done to fix the problem.
 We review our buyer communication thoroughly. All customer message has been answered, resolves refund issues, return request authorized, processed and concerns resolved to the maximum customer satisfaction.
 I have carefully re-read and go through all the Amazon policies, especially the one concerning the proper ways how to source inventory and Amazon anti-counterfeiting policy to ensure that, I will not violate then again.
 All listing, which authenticity is addressed by the customers have been completely deleted from my accounts inventory and will not be listing again
 Removal orders have been processed and the units were removed from our warehouse.
 We contacted our supplier and asked for proof of authenticity of the same item to reply to the customer.
 We returned the remaining stock of the supplier and no longer purchased the same products.
What will we do in the future.
 All inventory will be a source from reliable sources or directly from the manufacturers or authorized distributors who will be able to supply valid items to fulfill the amazon requirements.
 All units will be thoroughly inspected upon receipt to review their condition and ensure there are no-fault and damages.
 I will check carefully every item before listing that whether they perfectly match their amazon product page in every detail.
 Any inaccuracies will be resolved by updating the listing and fixing the incorrect information.
 I will make sure that items will be packaged as securely and carefully to prevent damage during delivery.
 I will check personally and regularly the inventory to ensure that all customers get the products in 100% perfect state.
I believe that these solutions are effectively addressing the problems noted by Seller Performance in my suspension notice. if we missed something then please let us know.
Our Supplier Information is given below. They are available during office time and due to COVID-19 issue if they do not reach your phone call then you can communicate with them via email.
Finally, we got a response this email
We received your submission but do not have enough information to reactivate your account. Why did I receive this message?
You have not sent us sufficient information that we previously requested from you to address our concerns with your account. For privacy reasons, we do not provide details about our investigation methods.
What happens now?
Your account will remain deactivated. If you have funds in your account, they will be available after any amounts paid for A-to-Z claims or chargebacks on your orders have been deducted. This usually takes about 90 days, but funds may be held longer. Depending on your account status and activities, you may be required to complete an additional review before funds can be released. Amazon may withhold payments if we determine that your account was used to sell inauthentic or prohibited goods, commit fraud or engage in other illegal or abusive activity.

1043,Bot Orders and Cancels on one ASIN - Now I am suspended,"I started selling a beauty product (name brand) a couple weeks ago (FBM), there were 2 other sellers. Sold a couple of them then noticed an order for all 54 units! I figured this is very strange, never had someone buy my whole inventory up. Did a little research and heard this could be a tactic to hold up your inventory so the other seller gets theirs out more. Didnt really know there was anything I could do but wait to see if they actually paid for the 54 units. About a week later the order doesnt go through, guess they never paid and the inventory gets returned to my account. I start selling a few here and there again. So I figure no issues. Flash forward another week and I get a notification of account suspension due to:
The Amazons Selling Policies and Seller Code of Conduct prohibit:
 any attempt to manipulate ratings.
 any attempt to manipulate feedback.
 any attempt to manipulate reviews.
 any attempt to manipulate sales rank.
 any attempt to misuse Amazon A-to-z guarantee.
I talked to the someone at Account Health Support and this one the only weird issues I had in the last year and half selling on Amazon so when we pull up the cancelled order for this same ASIN there for 259 in the last two weeks! Every 10 mins there was an order then a cancellation, has to have been a bot right? Who sits there and does that to another seller? So now I have to write a POA and try to explain that I wasnt the one doing the order and cancelling to manipulate the rank of this product. There doesnt seen to be much information I can get from the order cancellation to make out who did this, how do I prove it wasnt me in the POA. Any advice is appreciated.",Account Health

Im living in the UK and I have an LLC company and a business bank account in the USA. I thought that was enough to create an account in amazon.com (USA). But then I realized that I needed utility bills of the company. Then, because I have not utility bills (because Im not living in the USA), I created a company in the UK (with a business account and a verified address) and I used for amazon.uk. Now, I have my LLC company in Amazon.com and my verified UK company in Amazon.uk.
What do I should do? Should I leave them like this, or remove the USA company and just having the verified company from the UK in order to sell products in other countries (the USA included)?
Thank you.",Account Health
1046,Pls help! Misused ASIN variations repeatedly or impacted customer trust through the usage of incorrect variations,"We have receive the notification from Amazon on Jun 4th, and we have submitted the POA on Jun 8th, but reject by Amazon, below is our updated POA, anybody can offer some suggestion? Thanks in advance.
Dear Seller Performance Team,
We are very sorry violate the ASIN creation policy. (Misused ASIN variations repeatedly or impacted customer trust through the usage of incorrect variations.)
The root cause(s) of the variation policy violation :
1, In order to speed up the uploading of products, we created ASINs individually and then merged them with templates in the same parent ASIN. Many ASINss descriptions were not clear enough like parent ASINs page & title, child ASINs title, image, specifics, search term, and even brand uppercase.
2, In order to provide more choices for buyers, we referred to the method of other sellers used from this industry. These products are varied by interface ports number like 2/3/4/5/8/16 as we also thought they should be. If they were under a same parent ASIN, that could provide better buying experience. So we created new child ASIN like HDMI switch 8 port and added it to the existing parent ASIN of HDMI switch 2 and HDMI switch 4. The functions are same, but looks quite big or different.
3, Due to our typing error, bothMT-VIKIandMT-ViKImight be used under the same parent ASIN or title. so there were 2 different brands in the same parent ASIN.
4, We added the newer version HDMI 2.0 switch to the existed 1.4 parent ASIN. We thought buyers might be more interested. But ""Adding products that are newer versions or models of the parent ASIN policy was ignored.
5, After creating the parent ASIN or adding new child ASIN to the parent, we didnt check the relationship between child and parent ASIN to make sure they are correct for variation policy.
Immediate Corrective Actions:
1, In the past 4 days, we organized all the staff and fully studied Amazons policy like ASIN creation limit, Variation Policy and Duplicate ASIN creation policy. Meanwhile, we applied this policies to our ASINs, analyzed and compared them 1 by 1, especially about the policy of products images and/or names that are that are fundamentally different from the parent ASIN and newer versions or models policy.
2, We have checked all parent ASINs and child ASINs, removed or deleted all ASINs that violated the variation policy. see the attached
P reventative measures :
1, In the past several days, we have organized all employees to participate in the training of Amazon Variation Relationship Overview and ASIN Creation Policy , and conducted relevant content assessment tests to ensure that they all understand the policy clearly and no longer violate the regulations. We have deeply realized that even the same series of products in the company, if they are fundamentally different in look, function, material or version, we can not add them in the same parent ASIN. In future, we will keep training on the variation policy once a week.
In order to prevent adding the new version model or model with fundamental difference to the previous parent ASIN, we only allow the experienced specialist to edit ASIN or variation. Then our manager will check and analyze the new variations to make sure its complied with the Amazons policy, like child ASINs specifics, look, function, material, version, size, title, imagesetc
At the same time, we will also visit seller forum to discuss with other sellers when in doubt. if this way cant fix it, we will use contact seller support to get the final approval, instead of referring to the ways other similar sellers use.
4, Below the policy compare with our products.
Policy 1: Changing the products detail page (parent or child) to become fundamentally different from the original product listed.
 It will never happen because we only sell switch and splitter and only products with same name/material/function/others will be added in the same parent ASIN.\
Policy 2: Changing the parent products detail page so it does not match the children.
 Never, by now or future, we did not and wont change the parent details.
Policy 3: Adding products that are fundamentally different from the parent ASIN.
 We dont have this problem. Because our ASINs in the same Parent ASIN works the same functionally, no fundamental difference
Policy 4: Adding products images and/or names that are that are fundamentally different from the parent ASIN.
 Some child ASINs are slightly different on images because of input port numbers, but we have removed those with different look.
Policy 5: Adding products that are newer versions or models of the parent ASIN.
 Were sorry for misunderstanding this policy. 3 newer version were added to the old. They were removed and will never happen again.
Conclusion :
We take full responsibility for this mistake and will make sure that it does not happen again. As such, we respectfully request that Amazon reactivate the account. Thank you for working with us to resolve this issue.",Account Health

1049,Product blocked for previously solved IP infringement claim,"One of our best selling product has previously been restricted by Amazon after being reported for patent infringement claim on two patents by a company we will call company X. After arguing the case with Amazon and providing the necessary documents and proofs that our product wasnt infringing on any of those patents, Amazon dismissed the IP infringement claim and reinstated our product.
2 Months later the same company X resubmitted a patent infringement claim against our product but for only one of the patent this time. Amazon restricted the product again. We have provided again all necessary proofs and documents but Amazon refuses to move and keep re-asking us for the same things again and again in loop.
It seem unbelievable that Amazon would accept to open a new case for a IP infringement claim that was dismissed previously. In that case what would prevent competitor to keep submitting patent claim every time just to kill the competition?
The company X who has reported our products is well known for its aggressive and systemic practice to report any competitors products which are more or less related to theirs and this without any proof of patent infringement. They just try to suppress the competitions. Company X is also facing multiple other competitors in court for the same reasons and it has come to light that Company X may have contacts inside helping them with approving the IP infringement reports
This being said our product working principles are very different. We have patent filled in countries outside the US dated prior to the one the filling date of Company Xs patent.
We have tried to appeal and reinstate the ASIN with Amazon asking us for Proof of product authenticity (e.g., invoice, Order ID, licensing agreement, letter of authorization). We have provided all the invoices form our suppliers, all our certifications and patent filling and letter of authorization from supplier regarding the product. We have provided court documentations with the court definition of the patent terms used to describe Company X patent. Those definitions clearly shows that we do not use that technology. We have also proof that our product has been existing prior to Company X filling their patent which means that even if our technology would have been similar (which it is not) it would constitute Prior Art under US patent law.
The only answer we got from Amazon each time is to provide the same copy pasted message ignoring all our documents and asking for Proof of product authenticity (e.g., invoice, Order ID, licensing agreement, letter of authorization) which we already provided multiple times. They then ask for more details about the case issue, what we did to prevent this etc and once we provide those information they ask for Proof of product Authenticity again. They are lock in a loop.
It is surprising that an ASIN can be restricted, again, by Amazon based on an IP infringement claim without proof of an actual patent infringement especially when this IP claim was previously dismissed by Amazon and when the company claiming it, is well known for its predatory business practices to systematically suppress competition which are in clear violation of the US Antitrust Law.
Anyone have an idea how to get Amazon to have a look at our documents and to respect their initial decision which was to dismissed this unproved IP Claim?

1051,Multiple POAs rejected Used Sold as New,"Our flagship product (ASIN B07JFRFJG6) got suspended with a Used Sold as New reason on May 14, 2020. We are the original manufacturer of this item, and have submitted multiple POA appeals. So far, the first three have been rejected almost immediately, and the fourth one has not been responded to since May 21st. We would appreciate any help to get it reinstated.
We believe the real reason the ASIN got pulled, is a complaint from an FBA customer who received a cheap knock-off inside our packaging (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Q2CC29LJTIHD 6). The only way this could happen is if the previous buyer switched out our genuine product with the knock-off, returned it to Amazon, and Amazon then reshipped it to the end customer who then complained about it.
Here is one of the POAs that had been rejected:
What caused customers to complain about the condition of your items?
Customers received product box that was DAMAGED or OPENED, leading them to believe that they had received a USED item. We believe there are two root causes: (1) damage to the product box due to INSUFFICIENT OUTER PACKAGING, and (2) some customers receiving USED ITEMS that were returned by previous customers.
What have you done to resolve the issue(s) that caused the customer complaints about the condition of your items?
The Refurbish Unsellable Customer Returns option has been DISABLED within the FBA Refurbished settings sub category under Fulfillment by Amazon settings.
We have REVIEWED customer complaints from Seller Feedback, Customer Returns, Account Health, and Voice of the Customer dashboards to UNDERSTAND and ADDRESS the specific reasons for the returns.
We have REVIEWED and UPDATED our QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES to ensure that the product is stored, packed, and shipped appropriately, and will not be damaged when shipped.
We added TAMPER-EVIDENT SEALS to the product box to make it obvious when a customer returns a USED item, to ensure that it is not reshipped as NEW.
For all FBM shipments, we use CORRUGATED BOXES instead of PADDED ENVELOPES to securely protect the product box and its contents in transit
What actions will you be taking to prevent future complaints about the condition of your items?
We will create an FBA REMOVAL ORDER for B07JFRFJG6. Each returned item will be INSPECTED for Amazon Condition Guideline compliance before it is shipped back to FBA facilities.
NONE of the returned items from seller fulfilled or Amazon fulfilled order will be repackaged and sold as NEW.
Each item is CAREFULLY inspected to be in THE EXACT condition as stated in the Amazon Condition Guidelines: http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=1161242
Specifically, for NEW items, each item is confirmed to be a BRAND-NEW, UNUSED, UNOPENED item in its original packaging, with all original packaging materials included. Original protective wrapping is intact. Original manufacturers warranty still applies, with warranty details included in the listing comments.
We are confident that the measures that we have implemented will guarantee avoidance of all future condition-based complaints. We are kindly requesting that B07JFRFJG6 be reinstated, and our account be NOTATED of compliance with all issues. We look forward to hearing from you.",Account Health

Sincerely, Seller Performance Team
First, Id like to state that I do not have two seller accounts. I started this last summer and learned with a friend of mine how to sell on Amazon. I believe there are two possible reasons Amazon suspended my account.
I was suspended a few weeks after moving from my home in California to a hotel in Texas for an internship I am participating in. This meant that I was using wifi from the hotel and from my workplace to access my sellers account because I had no other way of logging in.
My friend, whom I learned how to sell from Amazon with, also had his account suspended a couple weeks before mine was, also for having multiple accounts. I do believe this is the most convincing reason Amazon suspended me. Especially when looking at the details. I sold two of the same products as he did, with very similar quantities; This is because we had one supplier in common. In addition, he started just a month or two before I did and we often hangout, being in the same location if Amazon tracks that. If he went to my house and used his phone to login to seller central, that could have been straw that broke the camels back.
Here is the appeal letter I wrote a month ago. It is not even close to perfect and I need to address the formatting to fit Amazons POA.
Dear Seller Performance Team,
I have received an email stating that my seller account has been suspended due to having multiple accounts. This is untrue however, I only have one account, Sunset Sales Online.
The one reason I can think of this misunderstanding is my recent relocation to a hotel in Texas due to an internship instead of in California where I go to school. The hotel also has free WiFi and I use it frequently. My internship is also in a government facility so Im not sure if that affects anything or might have triggered an account suspension.
Another reason why my account could have been deactivated in error is if Amazon thought my friends account was mine (***). He also received a suspension for being suspected of having multiple accounts. This was just about a week before my suspension. I could see how we could be mistaken for having multiple accounts because we sell products from the same supplier occasionally and we started around the same time frame in the same region.
The deactivation should be reversed because I can legally prove this business is mine and that this is the only account I own and use. I have attached my business registration, sellers permit, drivers license, and recent invoices from my supplier. The business registration shows my legal name and this business, along with my home address. The sellers permit I have obtained from the state of California also shows these details. If you wish, you may look up my business registration from the city of San Francisco. The invoices show my recent purchases with my supplier Globalis. They also have details about the purchase with my name and my address. This evidence and documentation can be furthered with the California drivers license I have attached as well. This proves my position on the suspicion that *** and Sunset Sales Online are both owned by me as it would show that I am not the person who owns ***. I believe this is enough to prove that this is the only account that I own, as I have documents from suppliers and government entities. There should be no other account that has these details and documents.
If there are any additional information that is needed please let me know so that this can be resolved in a timely manner.
The asterisks are where I put the name of my friends account. Id appreciate any input, feedback, or help to assist me out of this unfavorable position!
Thanks!",Account Health

Please help! I dont know what more to write to get my account active again. Amazon keeps saying that I have to send them a plan of action. This is what I sent and they said that that is not enough.
Root cause:
Many years ago, I listed a homeopathic teething product by using one of the existing Amazon listings. It violates Amazon policy. I did not know before listing the product. I had bought it for my baby at the time and did not use it so I tried selling it. It expired and I changed it to inactive in my account. I had listed it a long time ago before I learned of the restricted products that included homeopathic teething products.
Corrective measures:
I do not carry or sell that type of items at all now. It was a one time thing a long time ago. I deleted the listing. I have reviewed the Amazon Selling Policies, specifically the section regarding Drugs and Drugs Paraphernelia, which lists homeopathic teething products as being prohibited. I have combed through my inventory and made sure that there is no item that would fall under this prohibited category.
Preventative measures:

They are owner of the trade mark Past perfect and also are publishing different CDs on their protected label. Problem here is the same name of the label.
I cannot judge whether their actions are legal or not. I didnt care because it only affects about 100 of my 200,000 items. I then blocked the relevant articles for sale, deleted the listings and stopped pursuing the matter. Our account was blocked 4 weeks later.
Here is my plan of action, please let me know what you think:
The following problem has occurred. (Root cause of the policy violation)
We have violated the intellectual property rights of third parties.
Between December 20, 2019 and February 29, 2020, we received messages that we were violating the Past perfect brand (Trademark 76262420). We offered CDs published on the label Past Perfect Silver Line. The producer, who produced CDs on the label Past Perfect Silver Line about 25 years ago, broke the wordmark Past Perfect as Past Perfect is a protected word mark.
This affects ASINs B000057A98, B000057684, B00005799Y, B000057A58, B000057B2O, B000057BDG, B000057CYQ, B000057EGY, B000057G4R, B000057ISG and others. We bought these CDs as second-hand goods and offered them on Amazon.com for sale
We immediately took the following actions to resolve the problem::
We have blocked all affected products from sale. The products are no longer listed on Amazon.com.
I contacted the rights holder and said that we respect his rights and apologize. I have received a list of product codes, which products have been legally produced by Past Perfect and which have not been legally published
The rights holder informed me that products with UPC code 4011222 * were not produced by him. I removed all products with the UPC code 4011222 * from the sales.
I checked the rest of our products for violations of third party rights and removed suspicious products.
I have done the following to prevent that third party rights are infringed in the future:
I blocked all codes with 4011222 * for sales in my ERP system.
The employees are trained that the rights of third parties must not be violated when creating new listings. This must be checked in each individual case, especially when an article is newly created. It hat to be checked whether the respective article violates the rights of third parties. The item will only be put on sale if there are no doubts.
I will regularly check that the following rules are observed:
https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html?itemID=ZUQ6GBBXQVHQKF2&language=en_US&ref=ag_ZUQ6GBBXQVHQKF2_cont_201361070 1
https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/201361070 - here in particular the passage about Copyright Infridgement.
We will only buy from reputable retailers and we will trace every product where it was purchased. I understand that it is my responsibility to only purchase and sell authentic products that do not violate the intellectual property rights of third parties. I understand that customers trust that they will buy authentic products when they shop on Amazon and I promise to maintain that trust.
We understood that 'Target: 0 complaints or violations must be observed.
We will only list items on Amazon that already have an ASIN and do not generate new product pages.

My cost: $2.00 (Shipping supplies) + $3.20 (cost) = $5.20
Price calculation: $3.20 (cost) + $3.67 (shipping cost) + $2.00 (Shipping supplies) + $2.25 (Amazon Fee) + $0.94 (Marketplace Facilitator Tax )+ $2.94 (profit) = Total Selling price $15.00
Listing Price $15.00 minus $12.06 = Potential Profit $2.94
I have identified the following root causes:
Cost is too high
I sourced items at a cost that was too expensive to be competitive, or at least reasonably priced.
For the item cost above $10, my landing price was too expensive.
With the help of the account health manager, I was able to identify more root causes:
I never compared my prices to external big-box commerce sites. As I was made aware, my prices must be competitive across all major ecommerce stores.
My price per unit was higher than one in a multipack. My price was higher than what was acceptable. This is stated in the fair price policy.
I sourced from a retailer instead of a wholesaler.
Greater detail on the steps you have taken to prevent price-gouging going forward.
I have removed all items I received fair price violations from the catalog ad database (2 ASINs in recent warning list).
I will include shipping as an added price instead of including in the price of the item. To improve listing and pricing practices.
I have checked and reviewed my remaining inventory to be in compliance.
Greater detail on the steps you have taken to prevent price-gouging going forward.
Pricing will be set at a maximum of 4% less of the manufacturer suggested retail price and based on historical pricing data.
I will audit big-box ecommerce stores and collect data. l will identify brands, items, and other relevant data to develop a database that will allow for early warnings. Any such items that are not competitive are removed from my catalog.
Also, using third party pricing tools to look up pricing from 30 days up to 6 months prior. The sources that I will use are Amazon.com, camelcamelcamel.com, and keepa.com.
I will use a spreadsheet to monitor the price of every active listing.
I have located a new supplier in my area for shipping supplies. This decreases my shipping cost by 43%.
I will retire my old way of sourcing and move on to authorized suppliers and wholesale accounts. I will list the suppliers I am vetting:
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Weekly, I will check for any Amazon policy updates.
In summary, I would like to stress (again) that I never engaged myself, even in my mindset, in price gouging or taking advantage of people in this time of need and despair. In over 3 years, I have done nothing but strive to be an honest seller and provide impeccable service to customers.
It is unfortunate, and this is the first time, not realizing I needed to be aware of all recent selling prices as a reference point caused me to appear as bad sellers.
I look forward to getting this matter cleared so we can focus on serving our shared customers.

1061,"Used Sold as New Complaint, Amazon declining automatically","We have been selling on Amazon for 14 years, about 75,000 pairs of shoes per year. All products are branded, high end $80-$250 retail shoes. We purchase directly from manufacturers, in fact, the same exact suppliers and sales reps that sell directly to Amazon/Zappos. On a rare occasion we get one of these complaints, normally a customer who is angry because the package was mishandled by a carrier. We NEVER sell used shoes, returns are fully inspected and if the packaging and shoes are not 100% perfect, we auction them on eBay. Currently they are reviewing 10 items, all due to language used in either an email or return request using the words, scuffed, or look worn (this item was a distressed leather shoe designed to look worn), etc Normally they just review and get back to us with a thank-you and thats it. Currently they are holding 100% of our funds, and when we sent in the appeal, that includes 10 invoices, letters of authorization from the vendors and a fully explained POA that has always been sufficient addressing each issue, now they are rejected in minutes, meaning, NO ONE is actually reading these appeals? Are they short handed? Do they even care how egregious this is in the current financial crisis due to COVID-19?

Our stranded inventory was filled with various popular textbooks.
We appealed the complaint, canceled the listing and placed a return order for the quantity of 1, ASIN: 1305109007, Title: American Government Institutions and Policies. When we finally received the book, our book (with our sticker) was accompanied by two counterfeit copies (with Amazon stickers). We had no idea what to make of this.

1064,NEED help with Used sold as New POA,"Got an email about used sold as new complaint, first one.
Customer purchase jewelry ring opened return request (malfunctioning clasp) return was approved. I email customer asking to help us understand better what is wrong with ring (rings dont have clasps).
She said there was big scratch on center stone, but once i get ring replacement she will buy it again.
Happy customer. NEXT day I get used as new complaint.
Once I receive ring back I saw its not a scratch but line like inclusion, it is internal and does not rise to the top.
I wrote this POA and they responded they they want treated details standard robot letter.
Please help.
Its really not an issue of used and new its customer saw scratch / inclusion. What does it have to do with used anyway??? New stones can have scratch.
""Dear Amazon Product Quality Team,
The following plan of action is to determine a course of action to take for our listing which has been deactivated from Amazon catalog and I wish to be reactivated. I have thoroughly reviewed, investigated and addressed all complaints in order to achieve the best possible customer service.
ASIN: xxxxx
The issue that led to the complaints about the product condition or description of your items.
After reviewing all customer purchases returns, buyer-seller messages and all other forms of customer feedback, we identified a total of 1 complaint via buyer-seller messaging, 1 return requests, no negative product reviews out of 4 orders placed for this product on Amazon in the last 365 days. The complaint is summarized below:
Order ID: xxxxxx
The customer opened return request and stated via buyer-seller messaging that The ring I ordered had a huge visible scratch off center of the garnet. Thats why I am returning the ring.
Return was automatically authorized, prepaid return shipping label provided and full refund was issued once we received ring back. Upon receiving the ring back, we inspected it and confirmed that ring has an inclusion, internal scratch like line in the stone. The scratch is an inclusion that looks like an internal line but does not rise up to the top of the facet surface because the line does not refract light from the top of the facet surface.
There were no other complaints or returns regarding this ASIN.
Therefore, we can conclude that the complaints were caused by:
Insufficient inspection of the item when shipment received from manufacturer.
Insufficient inspection of the item prior item being shipped to customers.
Insufficient description stating that natural stone may have some inclusions.
The actions you have taken to resolve the issue that caused the complaints about the product condition or description of your items.
We have double checked the description on the website to ensure it is accurate.
We have made the following changes and improvements to our inspection policy and quality control to help prevent any future used sold as new complaints:
Each jewelry piece center stone will be examined for inclusion (natural imperfections), surface scratches and internal cracks. Any jewelry piece with scratch on center stone will be shipped back to manufacturer for replacement. Any minor natural inclusion will be disclosed in the description. Any Jewelry piece with large inclusion, or natural stone imperfections that maybe be mistaken by customer as scratch will also be sent back to manufacturer for replacement.
While jewelry pieces are safe inside of the jewelry box from damage caused by shipping, each jewelry presentation box is 4.5 x 4.5 x 2.25 inches and allows for plastic tag to move around relatively freely inside of the jewelry box. Each ring and earring is shipped with manufacture plastic seal tag will be wrapped with small piece of tissue paper or small ziplock bag over plastic tag to make sure that plastic tag will not cause any abrasion to jewelry surface. Each pendant ecklace that shipped with plastic tag will be placed in small ziplock bag to protect pendant from moving around next to the tag.
Specifically for this order that caused complaint we have followed up with customer and inform customer that ring will be shipped back to manufacture for a replacement and customer responded that she loves ring and will repurchase it once I receive it back.
We also informed customer that ring comes with certificate of authenticity and lifetime warranty from manufacturer so customer will feel confident in quality of her jewelry purchase from me.
The steps taken to prevent future complaints about the condition of your items in the future.
We will follow up with customer remedy any situation as quickly as possible.
We have implemented additional policies such as not to reuse jewelry box from returns, so packaging itself would be in great new condition, no scuffs or marks on jewelry box. So customer always receives item with great presentation.
Improve listing description to be more specific on stores clarity (on stones such )
We will be continuing inspecting each piece of jewelry to meet our quality control guidelines once order from manufacturing will arrive. Each ring is checked for listed ring size. Each jewelry piece checked and examined with magnification loop to make sure all stone settings are tight (make sure there is no loose stone). Each piece inspected for properly functioning rings clasp or closure (for earrings, pendants, chains and bracelets).
We will be including in the shipment info that each LeVian piece comes with certificate of authenticity and lifetime warranty from LeVian, for customer to be confident in their purchase.
We will clean jewelry pieces prior to shipment as well as keep storing jewelry in jewelry trays to prevent abrasions.
We will continue store jewelry in individual plastic bags as well as jewelry trays with covers to prevent any abrasions and dust particles.
All jewelry purchased from actual manufacturer LeVian.
Please see attached copies of invoices/ receipts from manufactures for ring in question.
Final Notes:
As per my investigation described above, I have determined primarily cause of the issue is related to insufficient description and inspection. While we constantly try to improve our product description and customer service in every aspect, we will pay extra attention to product inspection, description, packaging and the reason for returns. Furthermore, we will follow up with customers shall any issue arise and do our best to remedy any issues as quickly as possible to customer satisfaction.",Account Health
1065,Suspension for Used Sold As New,"Not sure how much help Ill get here since many forum members are so hostile towards dropshippers, but here goes First, some basic info:
I have been dropshipping since 2013. About $6 Million in sales in that time with annual sales now around $2 Million.
I was recently threatened with suspension over IP complaints. Seller Performance requested invoices. I sent order IDs and an explanation of my business. I was completely open and honest with them. They were both accepted and I was permitted to continue selling. Again: Seller Performance is aware of my business model and allowed me to continue selling. (This is important for those in the forum saying I have no future on Amazon as a dropshipper, so if thats what you are going to post here - dont bother. You are not the final authority on what is and is not permitted on Amazon.)
A few weeks ago I was contacted by Account Health stating suspension was imminent regarding Used Sold As New complaints. They requested a POA and invoices.
POA and invoices were submitted to Seller Performance. SP responded with an email requesting more information about the three areas they always ask for (the root cause, how I corrected, how to prevent), along with the full account suspension. The invoices were accepted and they no longer need those. They just want a better POA.
So that brings me to where I am now. I have completely revamped my business to be more lean and efficient in order to make Amazon happy. I do believe the changes I made, although a MASSIVE hit to my profits, are for the better. Much less stress to run the business if I can get reinstated. Im just not sure what else to include in my POA, which I will post below.
I am removing sensitive parts of the POA (such as brand names) that I would rather not everyone know.
The root cause(s) that led to the complaints about the condition of your items:
 Items we listed for sale were drop-shipped by hundreds of different manufacturers and we were not able to provide the manpower to oversee quality assurance at all these facilities.
 We failed to take the appropriate steps to ensure the items we sold are not easily damaged in transit. This was caused by a lack of oversight into the packaging and shipping practices of the many different manufacturers we worked with.
The actions you have taken to resolve the complaints about the condition of your items:
 We have scaled down our operation to better match that of our current capabilities by removing tens of thousands of items from hundreds of different manufacturers. This includes brands that were sometimes problematic with condition complaints, such as (cheap Chinese junk brand #1) and (cheap Chinese junk brand #2).
 We have removed brands that manufacture low-quality, easily breakable items. Some brands, such as (cheap Chinese junk brand #3), were often damaged in transit or simply left the warehouse in poor condition with numerous defects. This brand, and hundreds of others, have been eliminated from our catalog for failing to maintain quality standards that Amazon and their customers demand.
 We are now selling items exclusively from a single, highly rated brand (name of high quality US brand) that we have a long and healthy relationship with (since 2013). (name of high quality US brand) manufactures (specific item) which are not prone to damage in transit, and far less prone to defects during the manufacturing processes.
The steps you have taken to prevent future complaints about the condition of your items.
 We have completely revamped our business model with an emphasis on quality over quantity. Problematic items and brands have been removed. Future growth is now focused on working with a single, respected brand of (specific item) that are not prone to damage or defects.
 The manufacturer we work with will be sending samples of their (specific item) that we can scrutinize for defects and overall quality. In addition, the protection provided by the packaging, and quality of their packaging materials and methods, will also be examined on a regular basis. We plan on implementing this on a monthly basis with the more popular (specific item) that we sell. Any arising issues will be addressed immediately.
And thats it. Any CONSTRUCTIVE input would be greatly appreciated.",Account Health
1066,I am being slaughtered by unstopping false copyright claims made by vicious competitors!,"I was a full-time mom for 7 years and now Im a small business owner. I want to tell about my traumatic experience on Amazon. I have been cornered by vicious competitors who are trying to kill my product by abusing Amazons copyright infringement claims. I hope I can raise serious attention from Amazon. Ive done everything I could, but nothing works. So, writing in the forum is probably my last resort. Amazon seems to overuse AI on many things including reading appeals, so I hope my post can be read by real people.
One main question, why Amazon allows sellers to make copyright infringement claims without asking them to provide concrete evidence of the infringement? This encourages sellers to make false claims in order to take down their competitors. Such huge loophole has been exploited by many unethical sellers and I am a miserable victim of such violence. And I believe I am not alone in this case.
English is my second language, so please forgive me if I didnt describe things clearly. Now lets cut into the chase.
Feb 4th, 2020, my product was launched after my months of hard work. This product was well received by customers and quickly ranked to the top. This is the only profitable product I have. Im losing money on everything else and can hardly make ends meet.
Feb 24th, my nightmare began. I received a copyright infringement claim made by someone who purposely masked his identity with a weird email address minimax@brandshield.com. It didnt give any details about what exactly my infringement is. I was so confused as my product is listed under my own brand; my product has an active U.S. design patent; I have invoices, P.O. and the letter of authorization from the manufacturer; and my product images, packaging and user manual are all 100% original. There is not a single bit of infringement of anything. I appealed by submitting the required invoice, PO, patent and letter of authorization. Luckily, Amazon responded quickly to my appeal and reinstated my listing in 3 days.
March 4th, my product finally returned to where it was before that accident. However, my nightmare continued. The same day, I received a second copyright infringement claims from the same minimax person. I appealed with the same sets of supporting documents, and successfully reinstated my listing the very next day.
Then March 24th, I received the third copyright infringement claim. This time Amazon didnt provide the contact info of the claimer. But I have already become an experienced veteran and quickly got my listing reinstated.
However, my peace of life was ended just too soon. On April 19th, my real nightmare began. This time, my listing was bombarded by a series of copyright infringement claims from anonymous claimers and it lasted for almost a month. There were 17 claim IDs in total, all asking for the same sets of proof of product authenticity that have been used to reinstate my listing for the past three claims. However, this time my appeal didnt work. So here are the weird things:
It seemed that Amazon didnt actually read my appeals. No matter what I wrote, it just responded with a template with a new claim ID. And sometimes it didnt respond at all. It seems that I fell into an endless loop.
Other than providing the required documents, Amazon did offer another solution: contacting the claimer to retract the claims. But the problem is, Amazon didnt provide the contact info of the claimer, how could I make that contact? I wrote many times to Amazon to ask for it, no one answered. Another dead end!
Ironically, I have to pay 100 bucks to some so-called service provider; to uncover the email address of the claimer. I then wrote him a letter to urge him to provide the evidence of my infringement otherwise he will be responsible for making false claims. But of course, he didnt respond.
I filed the counter-notice pursuant to DMCA. Amazons copyright agent forwarded it to the claimer (different email address from what I dug out myself, but the name is the same. This guy is making multiple claims using different email addresses!). According to Amazons policy, if the claimer didnt provide Amazon with notice that a lawsuit has been filed against the counter-noticing party (me) within 10 business days, my listing will be reinstated. I waited for 15 business days and the claimer filed nothing. I thought the DMCA counter-notice would be the last resort provided by Amazon if everything else failed. But I was wrong! My listing was not reinstated. I wrote to the copyright agent and the dispute department 4 times, no one responded, and my listing was still dead-dead! Every day when I saw the Amazon dog on my listing page, I felt extreme pains in my chest. I have been hit hard by this pandemic and I am losing money every day. I am counting on this product to feed my kids but now I lost my only source of income, plus my husband lost his job too! We cant afford medical insurance and have to live in fears every day.
I called Amazons customer service. They showed empathy to me but told me that its not their business. They asked me to go back to the dispute department, but I know that is another dead end. I wrote to my account manager and I even wrote to Jeff. No one answered. Its not because I didnt try enough, its just because no one cares!
On May 14th, 26 days after my listing was removed, someone from Amazon finally got a chance to read my appeals and reactivated my listing. It then cost me a huge amount of money (which is supposed to be used for food and living supplies for my family) to re-promote it, and on May 21st, my product ranked back to the top. But I got no reason to feel happy about the renascence of my product, instead I feel deeply scared. I know the vicious competitors wont allow me a chance to survive. And I am right again. The same day, I got a copyright infringement claim again from the minimax guy. I am feeling extremely exhausted, desperate and helpless. I dont know what else I can do. I took another chance by using the appeal button. 5 days have passed, there is no response from Amazon. After such a long exhausting fight against false claims, this is no surprise to me at all. This time, my product only survived for 7 days. And Im sitting on a 40K worth of inventory, what can I do?
Now is 7 am in California time, I have spent a whole night writing this post. But this is just one of the many nights I spent on writing my appeals.
My product ranks at the top for a reason: it is very good quality and offers a great value to the customers. However good products like mine are killed by false claims, leaving the customers with no choice but lower quality products from sellers who play dirty tricks. Amazon should take serious measures, not just to solve my own problem, but also fix that huge loophole. With this, doing business on Amazon would be a lot more pleasant. We can then focus on developing better products and offering better services to our customers, rather than wasting time, energy and money on such ridiculous fights.
Please help me ! I wont give up my appeal. And I wont stop fighting for survival and for justice that good sellers deserve.",Account Health

Ive read some forums and it seems this happens often. Id like to give you guys some information regarding anything linked to this account info.
This is the first time Ive ever opened an Amazon Seller Account. I have a regular prime account. Are you guys asking me to link them somehow?
I have recently changed addresses and my FL drivers license doesnt recently show where I lived is that the issue?!
I believe one of my roomates also has an amazon prime account where they purchase things but dont sell anything on here.
Ive recently made this IIInfinity INC email with google to separate from my personal one.
I used my own computer to login where I live. Ive used my own credit card. Its under my bank account number with my address and phone number as well.
Please help me resolve this issue ASAP.
Ive reviewed all the documents Ive sent in to make sure theyre all matching credit card, id and bank statements are all in line. After interviewing my roommate I find out that the last person who was here opened an Amazon seller account and it probably got banned/suspended. I also have the same first name as him and I believe this could be an issue as to why my account got flagged.

February 25, 2020 12:09 PM EST
Additional information
Good evening , Amazon seller performance team.
After reading a couple of your forums about people who have similar problems I believe I have been able to discover the root cause of what led to my account being suspended.
Ive taken action by interviewing my roommate about whether someone in this household has opened a seller account years back and she told me they did and probably had their account suspended/banned.
A couple years ago, someone who lived here by the name of EX-ROOMMATE mightve also opened an Amazon Seller account under this address. This person no longer lives in this address and has been gone for a couple years.
Im logging in from the same house hold he use to log into and we also share the same first name, this mightve been something that couldve flagged the system into thinking it was still him trying to open up another account even though it was years ago. It sounds like there might have been some confusion as to whether or not I was him making a duplicate account but this isnt the case.
My name is John Rojas and Ive recently just opened this account only for my use.
In the future Ill make sure to login from my own devices since I was reading on the forums that logging in from other devices might cause problems. Going forward please message me if there is anything I can do to further resolve any issues that might arise. I can gladly procure any documentation that might help in resolving this as smoothly as possible.
This leads me to this post. Ive read lots of people speculating that it could be:
-Glitch on Amazons end
-Making an account in EU/Japan market when creating a new account ( Which Ive done but dont exactly remember signing up for it since Im just starting.)
-Someone in your household also having a Seller Account.
If anyone can help me get a reply from Amazon that would be great. If I hear back or get my account reinstated Ill post about it here. What really scares me is I havent heard of anybody getting there account reinstated yet. If you have please reply to this post!

About 5 years ago I created a seller account as my college research about Amazon.
As I learned back then that individual sellers are allowed and free of subscription fee back then. I havent sell anything at that time.
This year in the late January, I started to interest in selling online.
My first idea is back to Amazon. I login back to my Amazon account and found that the account has been deactivated due to inactive for a long long time.
I contact support and ask for reactivate the account.
Refer Case ID: 6760746521 January, 21st 2020.
The support told me
I recommend you to open a new seller account on Amazon as you wish to continue selling. You will need to use a different email address from the closed account to open a new account
Thats fine. I thought. This is my old email account anyway.
So, I started create new Amazon seller account at my current email.
The rest is something everyone know whatd happen.
I created a new account at my current email. registered at 3 market places.
US, including com, ca, com-mx
EU, including co-uk, de, fr, it, es
JP (my personal passion )
All of those got suspend due to related account in about 2 hours after subscription paid.
At first I was angry all around as I thought I got tricked right after the payment.
I asked the support and all came back with Please see your performance notification.
Suspended due to related account.
Yeah right, and Case ID: 6760746521 told me
I need to use a different email address from the closed account
The thing is, my previous account wasnt closed. Its inactivated.
So, by the automatic system. As those 2 accounts are registered by my name, surname, address in the same You know the drill
As I fled my appealing request all around like whole February 2020.
Asked support team to closed my old account (Refer Case ID 6774415211 January, 29th)
Do those identity confirmation, change from Debit card to Credit card payment method.
JP market place is the first to accept appeal in mid Feb.
And EU market place accept me back in late Feb.
I over joyed that these nightmare of suspend would end.
Except my most needed market place US.
As I fled my 12 submissions and 10 cases log.
The appealing never get response and all those help supports keep telling me is,
Please contact Seller Performance Team directly at Performance notification tab
And yes, they havent response at all for the past month.
Here is my questions
Is it ordinary? They may have a tons of cases like these and mine was in the list but they may take a few months before my turn?
When I asked my appealing in EU market place. Theses instant automatic message that they received it by email. But US market place doesnt?
This is the biggest issue here. As I downgrade my seller account to individual type, until everything settle down at least. All US market place com, ca has downgraded but com-mx still in professional type and did charged the second subscription fee already
I cannot manually downgrade com-mx to individual type, as the system said,
Changing selling plan is not allowed in one of your subscribed marketplaces.
I contact the support and every contact us push me back to account health issue.
And as you can guest.
Help Support > Please contact Seller Performance Team directly at Performance notifications
Performance notifications > Seller Performance Team > no response at all for the past month.
Any suggestion please?

These products are prohibited for sale or listing on Amazon. For more information, please see the seller Help pages on Laser Pointers and Related Products. Why is this happening? We took this action because this product is not permitted for sale on Amazon.com. It is your obligation to make sure the products you offer comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and Amazons policies.

Please note that moving a restricted product listing to Inactive (Out of Stock) does not make the listing compliant. If you think your product was incorrectly identified as a restricted product on Amazon, close the listing immediately to ensure compliance while you appeal the restriction with Seller Support.
Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team,
Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to appeal my seller accounts suspension for listing restricted products that are prohibited from sale on Amazon.
What went wrong / The Root Cause:
 In fact, I did unknowingly list a restricted product. I believe the error occurred in the information I provided when the listing was completed. Furthermore, Ive come to learn that Targus maybe a product that requires additional authorization to sell on your site
 Unfortunately, I am unable to specifically pinpoint where my error occurred. It was my intention to sell a stylus, which I do not believe is a restricted product, I can only surmise that the error occurred in the listing information that I supplied.
 I believe the error occurred in the listing. In the future to prevent this from happening, if theres anything that Im not absolutely certain about I will call you guys for a clear explanation.
 Please note, I was given 48 hours to remove the restricted products. However, at the time, I was given that
opportunity I never realized it. Upon my original account deactivation a few years back, I I was in the hospital and
unable to respond.
 At the end of last year, I decided to give selling another shot, I looked into my seller account, and I noticed the
newest performance notifications. After researching the Amazon Seller forums on restricted products, and how
to do plans of appeal, I prepared an appeal to state my case.
 Unfortunately, I no longer possess a picture of what I was trying to sell. Please keep in mind, this suspension.
ccurred about 4-5 years ago. I do apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
What I have done to fix the issue.
 I have carefully reviewed all of Amazons guidelines. Furthermore, to prevent any such violations from occurring in the future, Ive researched information regarding the sale of restricted products, the correct way to aadvertise my products.
 Ive educated myself about the products that are prohibited from sale and cant be listed. This includes your Restricted Products policy, including the Examples of Prohibited Listings section. Though its important to point out Ive never missed it a prohibited item, I have educated myself on what those items are to prevent any problems in the future.
 The final step Ive taken is to remove all of the listings that were in doubt, and being questioned. In the future, I will double check all of my listings to make sure that the products are described accurately, and are fully compliant with the rules that Amazon has set forth.
What I will do to prevent this from happening again:
 Ive educated myself about the products that are prohibited from sale, and cant be listed. This includes your Restricted Products policy, including the Examples of Prohibited Listings section. Though its important to point out Ive never missed it a prohibited item, I have educated myself on what those items are to prevent any problems in the future.
 Before listing any new items on Amazon, I will verify that they are permitted for sale, and compliant with Amazon policies and procedures.
 To help ensure that I do not violate any more policies, I will also research whether all of my products are accurately described, and correctly listed in the most informative way for any potential buyers.
 Weekly Reviews of:
Amazon Policies
Seller Central Updates
Amazon Seller Support Forums
Laws/Regulations on sites such as
CPSC.gov:
Small/ e-commerce businesses can use this site to determine which, if any, of their products have safety recalls and/or alerts
Recalls.gov:
This site will tell you if the product youre selling is unsafe, hazardous, or defective.
Product Updates
These reviews will ensure I maintain strict adherence to all of the above.
 New Listing Method:
The 3 Rs - Reasearch, Reveal, Review , then Post
Research
This step ensures I dont encounter this dilemma again, it will include me ,
Checking into your policies
All Laws and Regulations
Product Updates and Recalls
Reveal
This step is to simply list the item that I'm trying to sell.  I called reveal because here is where I reveal                 
everything about the product, such as photos, condition,  description etc.

Review
The final step is to review what I am trying to list for sale. At this point, I will review all of my research,
what I am trying to reveal, and Ill take this opportunity to give my listing one final look over.
Post 
Then, my product will be ready to be successfully listed!
 My weekly reviews, and new listing method should be my safeguard to fix my root cause I the future!

 These corrective  actions will ensure I can immediately take action, and proactively remain compliant with my     
   listings.  Any products that I am unable to verify with 100% certainty, will not be listed.
In conclusion , I believe that this plan provides that this issue has been rectified, and itll be prevented from occurring again. I look forward to having my selling privileges restored. I also look forward to hearing from you! Thanks again for your time!
SIncerely,
Kwylas

1076,Please help! my Amazon account has deactivated,"I made seven appeals, but Amazon says: You still have not provided sufficient information to reactivate your account.
Let me know whats wrong with my appeal and what needs to be added to give Amazon enough information.
Root cause:
I have listed mask 21 times but Amazon is not approved. I was frustrated that my product was not approved by Amazon.
When I looked at Amazon products, I found products listed as face covers instead of masks at product title. And the product was listed in the Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry category. I thought it was a matter of listing the title Mask and listing it in the Health & Household category. I thought that lists of products that are not medical or coronavirus-related should be listed as title of face covers and listed not Health & Household category.
I listed as a face cover and listing it in the Cloth item category and shipped with 17 orders approved by Amazon on 4/26/2020. Then my seller account was deactivated on 5/1/2020.
And I received Performance notifications from Amazon on May 18, 2020 through six appeals, and through this I found out why my account was suspended.
The reason my seller account was deactivated is that I insisted on unauthorized medical marketing for viruses, bacteria or flu in the product description.
My product is just a face cover. However, I inserted the phrase Protect Germ in the product description. It is violates Amazon policy.
The reason I put the phrase Protect Germ in the description of this product is because the fabric of this product was actually tested by the Korea Testing Institute.
However, this was not an appropriate product description because it was not approved by the US FDA. Since I am selling to US consumers, I have to follow the recommendations of the US FDA, not Korea. I didnt know before listing the product. This caused a problem and now I know.
Corrective measures:
I deleted listing Restricted Product Policy Violations.
There are no other products in the inventory that can no longer violate Amazon policy.
I read review of my listing practices and Amazon polices to identify a potential gap. I understanded and checked Restricted products, Listing Restrictions That Require Statements or Disclosures of Amazon policy.
Preventative measures:
I made the mistake of listing the wrong category product with wrong product description.
In the future, we will follow Amazons recommendations and follow Amazons policy for my listing. I promise to check the three below and list them on Amazon before listing the product in the future.
one. Before listing on Amazon, I will verify that the manufacturer of the product is Amazons trusted manufacturer.
I will check if other products from the manufacturer that I will sell to Amazon are sold to Amazon. If sold, they are a manufacturer trusted by Amazon. If the manufacturers product isnt on Amazon, Ill contact Amazon by purchasing a sample of the product I want to sell to Amazon. I will use forums, Contact Amaon, Case Log.
two. Ill check Amazons policy for the category of products Im trying to sell to Amazon.
In particular, Ill check Restricted products, Listing Restrictions That Require Statements or Disclosures and start listing after understanding Amazon policies.
I have only 1 product listed on Amazon. I plan to sell clothing, cosmetics and fashion accessories. For this, Ill check these pages Art-Home Decor, Cosmetics & Skin / Hair Care, COVID-19 Supplies, Export Controls, Jewelry & Precious Gems, Medical devices and accessories, Offensive and Controversial Materials, Pesticides and Pesticide Devices, Recalled Products, Warranties, Service Plans, Contracts, and Guarantees, Other Restricted Products.
But I might sell other products. In this case, on the Restricted products page, I will review all possible restrictions in the area of the product I will be selling.
And Ill check Textile Product Descriptions, Wearable Animal Fur Product Descriptions, Wool Product Descriptions on the Listing Restrictions That Require Statements or Disclosures.
Also, I understood all the examples in the Restricted Products FAQ and I will refer to all case.
three. Ill check important Amazon alerts, such as Covid 19, twice a week. If there is a problematic listing, close listing first and contact Amazon to check, and if there is a problem listing, Ill follow Amazons policies and recommendations.
I will use Amazons Selling applications before listed on Amazon. I will verify that all documents have been prepared prior to submission.
-Products you intend to offer (including all product and brand names)
-Seller name and ID
-Company name
-Company description
-E-commerce store or company website
-Contact information (phone and email)
-proof of purchase from a brand owner or credentialed manufacturer is required
-At least 1 purchase invoice for the products from a manufacturer or distributor
-Photos of the product or its packaging
-Consent to Amazon s Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy
I will control all of this myself. Amazon listings, Amazon policy compliance, and Amazon customer management will all be done myself.
I am responsible for all duties and responsibilities related to Amazon Listings.",Account Health
1077,Seller-fulfilled account deactivated for no given reason,"Hi there! So, our seller-fulfilled account has been deactivated, and has been for maybe almost a month? Except its really confusing. We werent given any notice that our account was deactivated. The only reason I found out was because I was doing my regular performance check and making sure everything was still moving smoothly. As soon as I noticed it, I sent in an appeal on May 14th explaining that I just saw the red banner at the top but wasnt sent any notification of any kind about it. There havent been any new problems with anything withing the last 6 months at least. What is stranger is that we have still been selling seller fulfilled items, but they have significantly decreased in how much we are selling. We sent in another submission to our appeal with pictures of all the information we have (or lack thereof) and have yet to hear from Amazon. Does this process normally take this long? Is there something we can do to move the process along quicker? Is this just a glitch? Attached is all the information we have (which again, shows nothing that we have been able to catch).

We had a general business conversation (no detailed specifics), I asked her some questions , which she answered and promised to follow up with me with two emails about specific issues. Phone number was Amazons number (suppose it could have been spoofed). I received no follow up emails after call. We used to have an account rep many years ago, so it did not seem strange, although I was surprised to receive a call.

1081,"Suspended Twice for Variation Violations, Employee Fired but Amazon Wont Respond to Our Appeals","For over 30 days now weve been trying to have our account reinstated from our second suspension.
The individual who managed our account created improper variations using size variants. Our account was suspended initially on March 6th. We removed all of the affected variants and were able to reinstate our account after a few days after submitting 3 POAs making a few changes each time.
Despite absolute understanding and internal training, inexplicably this employee created improper variations again on April 27th. We received a notice of variation abuse at 11pm, and our account was suspended at 2:13am the following morning, April 28th. To make matters worse, this employee drafted an appeal at 6am basically telling Amazon they were incorrect to suspend us before anyone in management had realized the account had been suspended. The employee was immediately terminated.
To date we are on our 10th appeal. We have enlisted the help of a lawyer who specializes in account recovery. We have continuously re-drafted our POAs, and weve combed over these forums endlessly to absorb the advice we have seen here. We have not received the dreaded We may not respond to your emails reply. We have not emailed Jeff@. While we initially crafted our POAs to focus on terminating the responsible employee, we have even softened our blame, understanding that we are the business and that AMZ doesnt care who did what.
After the first 3 appeals we received emails back stating they reviewed the POA but we were not allowed to sell on Amazon. More recently, weve not received any communication. Weve called into the help center and theyve informed us it was not accepted. And on our most recent, the help center is telling us that it has not been reviewed yet.
We are desperately seeking any advice. I will copy the contents our our latest POA below:
Plan of Action  Updated June 1, 2020
The root cause of the variation policy violation
We created variation families with children that were fundamentally different products from the parent ASIN. These errors continued after our previous reinstatement because we did not incorporate an adequate level of management oversight into the variation creation process. For example, under Parent ASIN: [B087NFHZXT] we listed abusive Children: [B00TACULKS B00TACUJTG B06XR2P7N3 B0778X4XK1] that varied by different product styles.
We did not properly train our staff on Amazon variation policy and the proper use of size and color variation themes. We incorrectly used the size variation theme to list ASINs that varied by different styles. E.g. [Parent ASIN: B087N8WZDZ] [Children: B00WAMZ1UU B00WAMZ4SE B00XK92T8E B0778VJKGM B06XR3387T B087N4TWYX]
Though we fully implemented our plan of action from our previous suspension, we failed to identify and act upon gaps in our process that led to further violations of Amazons listing policy. We have now reviewed and overhauled our listing creation process, to ensure no future issues occur.
Immediate Actions taken to resolve the variation policy violations
We have audited our entire catalog of ASINs to analyze all mistakes and issues that existed within our ASIN creation and variation procedures. We have removed all ASINs that violated Amazon policy, including B087NFHZXT & B087N8WZDZ.
On May 1, 2020, we retrained our ecommerce team on Amazons ASIN creation policies.
On May 4, 2020 we appointed an employee as our Listing Compliance officer and Implemented standard operating procedures that ensure management oversight of the ASIN creation process.
The steps taken to prevent the misuse of variations going forward
Our newly appointed Listing Compliance Officer, who has extensive experience selling and managing products on Amazon, is responsible for implementing our overhauled SOPs to ensure full compliance of all Amazon policies.
All variations will be checked against the following, before being added or updated in Amazon catalog:
Does the category support parent-child relationships?
Are products fundamentally the same?
Could the products share the same title?
Do the products vary only in a few specific ways that do not alter the nature of the product (such as color or size)?
Would a customer expect to find these products together on a single product detail page?
Does this ASIN follow Amazons variation policy guidelines?
Our Listing Compliance Officer will be responsible for facilitating mandatory listing compliance training sessions with all new hires, and with the entire ecommerce team on a quarterly basis, or when an update is made to Amazon policy. This training includes:
ASIN creation policy https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/201844590
Only true variations, that are not fundamentally different from the parent product will be added as children.
Variation relationship overview https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/8831
Variation Themes will only be used for their defined purpose. E.g products in a size variation theme will be identical in every way other than size.
Category style guide for Automotive parts and accessories - https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/rainier/help/Automotive_Style_Guide.pdf
We will not link any products that are not a variation of size or color to a parent product
Audits of all variations will be performed bi-weekly. Using the category listing report the listing compliance officer will review and fix any incorrect contributions from other sellers, to ensure that our listings remain 100% accurate.",Account Health

THIS IS MY LAST POA
Dear Seller Performance Team ;
Thank you for providing me the opportunity to appeal my seller accounts suspension for listing products that require a restrictions products and direction for their use and, they are prohibited from sale on Amazon.
I am the owner of REDDOOR I have been selling on Amazon.sg since 15 JUNE 2019.
I have a 4 memebership on my team.
I am writing in response to our account suspension, with a plan of action to address our claim of a restrictions products.
Root causes of the violation:
*I(Muhammet Omer Aydemir) was aware about the policy of not permitted sale regulations on Amazon.sg; but we have made a bulk listing and, our product listing of in charge Nick Gonima was not aware the products we were selling are not permetted for sale on Amazon.sg
Nick Gonima was not trained properly to do listings on amazon.sg : Because he is trained to do listing on amazon.com where this products are not resricted to sell for our Amazon USA seller account. Where recognized it is a mistake on our side that occured when he listed a product by not being aware it was not permited to be sold amazon.sg.
*Emily Johnson (policy and regulations incharge of amazon.sg) are failed to read the Amazon guidelines and Singapore local laws regarding the resale of drugs and dietary supplements, especially the Restricted Products policy and Singapore Consumer Product Safety Act and listed products which are prohibited from sale on the site.
*Nick Gonima(product listing of in charge)
A. Nick Gonima collects asins from the products that we sell.
B. Nick Gonima scannes the barcode of products with barcode reader.
C. Nick Gonima picks scanned listings from software to listing in bulk.
D. Nick Gonima carefully reviews product listing regulations and safety of local laws and market policies before uploading process.

*This includes Restricted Products policy, including the Examples of Prohibited Listings part. I also read all applicable laws, including the Singapore Consumer Product Safety Act, Singapore - Information for Retailers, Singapore  Importing goods regulations, and subscribed for Singapore Product Safety News.
*After reading the lists of prohibited products, We went through entire inventory together which is Restricted Product and removed any items that may have been in a violation of the Amazon policies, restrictions or applicable Singapore laws.
*After, we also double checked all the remaining listings to make sure that the products are described accurately and are fully compliant with the rules that Amazon has set forward.
Preventive measures:
*Before listing any new items on Amazon, we will verify that they are permitted for sale and compliant with Amazon policies and applicable laws.
I and Nick Gonima, Emily Johnson will regularly review the Amazon policies again to catch any of their updates and monitor changes in laws and regulations to ensure I and Nick Gonima, Emily Johnson can immediately take action and proactively remove any potentionally incompliant listings on time.
I and Nick Gonima, Emily Johnson will not use the Inventory Loader to import our SKU database in bulk, we have put in place a process by which we check for compliance of an ASIN by referring to misuse of drugs act singapore, Category, Product & Content restrictions on Amazon.sg before we give approval to list the ASIN. We are listing each ASIN individually from now on and there is no ASIN will be able to be uploaded unless it is compliant.
As a precautionary measure we have removed over 132 skus from our inventory and Amazon Seller Central until they can be more thoroughly evaluated.
 I and Nick Gonima, Emily Johnson have implemented a new system , I have hired Virtual Assistant from Singapore

https://cpsa.enterprisesg.gov.sg/totalagility/forms/custom/publicsite/login.html
 We now check our inventory on a regular basis which will include listings that are added using inventory feeds or uploaded using automated systems.
 If we do not receive confirmation from Laxmi Yeram that the product is not restricted, we will not sell the product on Amazon.
 Nick Gonima, Emily Johnson and Laxmi Yeram will now be holding a weekly review of Amazons policy, so they are always up to date, and able to ensure our business and products are complaint with Amazons policies;
 We have carefully reviewed Amazons Restricted Products policies in the Amazon Seller Central Help page. That we will not sell those products in the future.
 We understand the sale of illegal, unsafe, or other restricted products is strictly prohibited.
 We also reviewed Amazons Drugs & drug paraphernalia policy in greater detail that we will not sell those products in the future.
 We acknowledge our mistake regarding the products at issue and we understand that certain loperamide offers are restricted to support limitations that we will not sell those products in the future.
 We understand that we are responsible for ensuring that our listings comply with all applicable laws and Amazons policiesthat the products we willnot sell.
 For this reason, we hired an Laxmi Yeraw who specializes in Singapore laws and regulations to ensure compliance with all Amazon policies.
 Before sourcing any new products, we will be sure to research the product so that we are confidently sourcing products that are complaint with Amazons policies and standards with Laxmi Yeram.

1085,B2B opportunities,"Good evening everyone, on my Amazon seller page as well as my B2B opportunities page Amazon recommended I sell a product. I called Amazon and inquired about this asin and they told me if Im selling the same product ( t-shirts) to list under that asin which I did. After about a month I received a IP complaint that I was selling counterfeit and one for Trademark infringement. I contacted Amazon and seller-support told me to email the notice dispute link and have them reinstate me for the listing. I got an email back with the typical response of please provide invoices blah blah from the owner of the listing which of course I dont have as I have my own brand. I havent received any performance notifications but I did appeal with emails from seller-support and a copy of my B2B opportunities page showing Amazon recommending I sell this product So my question would be what should I do? Should I just submit a POA and even tho I contacted Amazon before I listed and just admit guilt or should I continue to provide documents showing I contacted Amazon prior to listing and that seller support says I can list? Any insight would be helpful because even tho I have no performance notifications Amazon has over $30k of disbursement next week for me. Ive never received a IP complaint so this is new to me, Thanks in advance!!!",Account Health
1086,My Seller-fulfilled offers and privileges got deactivated because of Amazons Drop Shipping Policy violation,"This is what AMZ informed:
Please help me to review my fist PoA, thank you!
After carefully researching Amazons Drop Shipping Policy I have found The root cause(s) of the Drop Shipping Policy violations.
My business model was Purchasing products from another online retailer and having that retailer ship directly to customers which against amazon policy.
I could not control online retailer inventory. Therefore, when they was out of stock, I had to cancel or refund customers orders that made customer had bad experience with amazon shopping.
I did not check and handle the product by myself. So, there are complaints about the product status.
I did not identify myself as the seller of my products on all packing slips and other information included or provided in connection with them.
I did not remove packing slips, invoices, external packaging, or other information identifying a third-party drop shipper which made customer confused about where the package shipped from.
My online retailer was responsible for accepting and processing customer returns of my products that make return process more complicated and dissatisfied customers
 The actions I have taken to comply with Amazons Drop Shipping Policy.
I stop the former business model
I have made sure all buyers having issues have been fully refunded
I have research carefully about Amazons Drop Shipping Policy
I have removed all active listing that concerns to FBM
All messages and return requests from the customer are responded within 24 hours
The steps I have taken to prevent violations of Amazons Drop Shipping Policy going forward
All my stock now is purchased from reputable distributor and manufacturer. And the orders is fulfilled by myself.

1088,Counterfeiting Complaint received,"Hello,
I am new seller on Amazon and as such I am still learning about how to sell professionally on the platform. I received a complaint about counterfeiting, this is because I matched an existing ASIN and sharing the same product detail page. According to Amazons policy counterfeiting is when I used another persons trademark on my product or packaging. I did not do any of these. My product has its own label that bears a separate name.
Questions:
How do I avoid being flagged for counterfeiting if I matched to an existing ASIN?
Must I buy from the same manufacturer or supplier as the person who originally created the Product detail page so I can have the right to sell?
What are the general mistake to avoid when matching an existing ASIN on a product detail page?
I anticipate your answers.

What caused customers to complain about the condition of your items?
Based on customer reviews, it looks like they were expecting a more robust shredder. The users could possibly be overfeeding the capacity, or exceeding the 2-minute runtime. We encourage the user to contact the manufacturer for questions or support, but they are not contacting the manufacturer, just returning directly back to Amazon. The product is also shred tested at production and some shards may be left in the basket, giving the appearance of a used product. We insert a yellow warning sheet explaining the tested paper shards and that this is normal. Since the product description cannot be edited, we cannot update with a warning of tested shards in the basket.

Anyway, Ive submitted 3 action plansso detailed that I eventually started to sound repetitive. Ive tried to stay on point, concise, to-the-point. Heres the action plan that was rejected:
""Dear Amazon Team,
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to appeal my suspension. I submitting this appeal in effort to explain in detail, the root of cause of the infringement, what actions Ive taken to resolve the infringements, and how to prevent further infringements in the future.
WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT WENT WRONG?
We sourced these makeup brush sets from Yiwu Omore Jewelry Co., Ltd. After a brief search, we found many existing listings in the catalog. We listed under these existing listings without reaching out to the Brand owners to seek permission. During this period, we began receiving direct inquiries pertaining to these items, from competitors. These appeared threatening in nature and were incoherent and difficult to understand. I did not consider that we were infringing on the brand owners intellectual property. Subsequently we started receiving orders from these competitors, and shortly after we would receive policy warnings, claiming our items were inauthentic. Failure to resolve these infringement issues, resulted in temporary suspension of my seller account.
THE ROOT CAUSE(S) FOR THESE INFRINGEMENTS:
 We did not have a review process in which to provide oversight to ensure that our product is a 100% match to the product detail page. This subsequently led to customers not receiving consistent products, resulting in a poor customer experience, and violation of rights owners.
 We failed to seek authorization with brand owners, nor did we contact the brand owners prior to selling under their existing listing, which resulted in non-compliance with the IP infringement policy
 We did not immediately remove the affected ASINs after receiving multiple policy warnings, informing me that my item(s) were infringing on the intellectual property rights owner(s). Nor did I respond or appeal these violations.
 We failed to ensure that my products were properly vetted and documented prior to listing on Amazon.
 We failed to immediately respond to IP policy complaints via the contact information provided in the complaints.
 We failed to properly source our product(s) and maintain a proper supply chain documentation, such as: certificates of authenticity, proof of legality, and proper POs and invoices.
 We failed to retain professional legal advice in order to ensure compliance with intellectual property rights policy and the anti-counterfeit policy before ordering and listing any item(s) on Amazon.com
STEPS TAKEN TO RESOLVE THE INFRINGEMENT ISSUES:
 We have contacted rights owners: He Bo, WEI, Jianmin, SWEETV, WB, TOMTOPTECH, AdPartner, Huntmic, WeChip, Jassins, Fezlens, via the contact information provided. I explained to each rights owner the events which lead to the infringements. I included an apology for the violation, and asked them to retract the complaint in good faith.
 ASINs: B06XXDB7DG, B06XXGYNBM, B082LSL47T, B07T1HJN1N, B07T5RLLSM, B082DD6CZV, B07PQVXPY8, B082FTT78, B07CVSZ58G, B07T2HQ32C have been permanently deleted from my inventory.
 We have decided not to sell these products, and all affected merchandise has been disposed of.
 Every potentially suspect ASINs, along with every item obtained from Yiwu Omore Jewelry Co., Ltd, have been permanently deleted.
 All business ties with Yiwu Omore Jewelry Co., Ltd, have been severed.
HOW WILL I PREVENT FUTURE INFRINGEMENT ISSUES FROM OCCURING?
 We have retained legal counsel in order to verify and properly vet future items, to ensure they are in compliance with Intellectual Property Laws, Trademark, and Brand ownership
 We will only source products through authorized distribution companies, whom can produce proof of authenticity, and provide us with proper supply chain documentation.
 Prior to listing any item, my legal counsel will search the registered brand database, to ensure that we wont be infringing on a registered brand.
 Brand owner messages and policy warnings will be met with swift and immediate action, in order to resolve any disputes in order to avoid any further conflict
 We have implemented a listing review oversight process, in order to ensure 100% compliance with item detail pages.
And here is my reject notice:
"" Hello, Thank you for submitting your plan of action. We reviewed your appeal and determined that the corrective action items you have listed have not been implemented.

Im looking for any advice with my suspension and POA. A quick background: someone placed and canceled over 1000 orders for 1 ASIN (it was 50/50 orders of 2 of the child variations). I saw that my inventory kept going to zero and couldnt figure it out. Then I was suspended and Amazon explained on the phone call they thought I was placing the orders to boost search results.
Performance Notification: (also note they didnt even bother to copy/paste my name in the greeting, it just says Dear,)
Dear,
We received your submission but do not have enough information to reactivate your account at this time.
How do I reactivate my account?
To reactivate your account, please send the following:
 The root cause(s) of the Sales Rank & Search and Browse violation;
 The actions you have taken to resolve the policy violation; and
 The steps you have taken to prevent this violation in the future.
How do I send the required information?

What happens if I do not send the requested information?
If we do not receive the requested information within 17 days of the original notification, your account will remain deactivated.
POA:
After speaking on the phone with the account health department I understand that my seller account was suspended for sales rank / search and browse violation.
From 5/6/2020 to 5/12/2020 over 1000 orders have been placed and then cancelled for ASIN XXXXXXX , and mostly two of the child variations ASINs XXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXX. These orders are sales rank abuse which is against policy. Here are 3 out of the over 1000 fraudulent order IDs as an example: XXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXX
Before I became aware of these orders, I opened up a case with support on 5/10/2020 (Case ID XXXXXXXXXX) because I thought there was technical issue with adding inventory. Now I see that it was these fraudulent orders being placed/cancelled so they slowly moved the inventory to zero.
Also for these ASINs I opened multiple cases with Brand Registry for counterfeit offers on the listing. Here are the dates and Complaint IDs of those:
4/11/2020 Complaint ID: XXXXXXXXXX
5/4/2020 Complaint ID: XXXXXXXXXX
5/8/2020 Complaint ID: XXXXXXXXXX
5/12/2020 Complaint ID: XXXXXXXXXX
I have been on top of getting counterfeit offers removed from listings as soon as possible and making sure everything is the best experience for the customer.
I am not the one placing these orders and no one associated with me is. I am the only staff member and person with access to this seller account so it could not have been another employee. I have reached out to all business advisors and friends/family and there is not anyone who it could have been. Unfortunately I cannot see any more information about the orders since they were cancelled. Also since my account is suspended I cannot contact support to find out any more information.
I absolutely have no association with whoever is doing this.
I have never had this issue with my account before and have been in business for 10 years, 3 years on Amazon.
I have reviewed Amazons selling policies and code of conduct repeatedly, specifically this page:
https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G1801
Under the Acting Fairly section these orders would fall under an unfair activity that manipulates sales rank. I failed to recognize these orders coming in and did not properly try and stop them.
For the future:
I will keep in constant contact with seller performance and report anything suspicious immediately . As you can see above I tried to keep in contact with Amazon when this issue started, but now I see it was not through the correct channels, and I have learned from this experience.
Now that I see this can happen I will monitor all orders coming in, especially the cancellations. I will also close the listings/make the inventory zero so that the orders will stop immediately.
I will make sure that everything is followed in the future and will continue to make sure I keep up with any new rules/regulations.
I have also learned how to contact account health immediately on the phone for pressing issues. I will keep in constant communication with Amazon.
Thank you for your time
I believe I could make it a little bit easier to read. Im just so frustrated and stressed out that I have completely lost my source of income over something I didnt even do.

1095,Amazon holding our account hostage for another sellers balance,"Towards the end of 2019, Amazon reached out to us about setting up a Renwed account for items that we sell in refurbished condition.
In early 2020 we set up the account with the help of an Amazon representative (lets call him Matt). We asked one of our employees (lets call him Chris) to work with Matt to set up the account, set up listings and get things going for us.
Shortly after setting up the account, getting products to FBA and making sales, we noticed some suspicious activity. Our items are selling like crazy. Too crazy. Many orders are a quantity of 3. Countless orders cancelled shortly after placing them.
Seeing this, we screenshot everything and send it to our account rep so we can document the fraud before it gets us. Weve seen this before, lots of cancelled orders, one star poorly-written negative feedbacks fly in (some of the feedbacks were for packages that were returned to us by the carrier because they couldnt be delivered to the phony addresses).
Matt is very appreciative that were so diligent in monitoring the account and thanks us for the information while he passes it on to the respective teams to process.
Because its a new account, when there are issues the account gets suspended for review as soon as a red flag pops up. We suspected this may happen which is why we reached out to Matt before it happens. So we know there will be a problem, but having it all documented and coming to Amazon with it should offer us some form of protection. Right?
Of course it doesnt. But heres where the story gets weird.
Amazon comes back to us and states that our account is related to another Amazon account. They demand to know how and why the accounts are related. They give us the name of the other account that were related to, and weve never heard of it. We state so adamantly and provide all legal documentation to prove that were not related to that company. Its not enough. Our rep Matt appeals for us. More legal documentation. Still no progress. Four months of appeals.
Then we receive (what turns out to be, thus far) our last communication from our Amazon rep. Below is a quote from the email with the store names removed for privacy:
There appears to be some compelling evidence that (OUR STORE) is connected to (NOT OUR STORE) in some way . (NOT OUR STORE) has a history of selling well on Amazon and has a large FBA inventory. The only reason the (NOT OUR STORE) account is suspended is for a past due bill stemming from FBA late storage fees. Both the (NOT OUR STORE) and (OUR STORE) sites can be reinstated right away if the (NOT OUR STORE) past due amount is paid.
No explanation for the connection would have to be submitted, and no POA.
The (NOT OUR STORE) account is past due by about $27,500.
It turns out, our employee Chris, who we had working with Matt to set up the account has prior experience working at (NOT OUR STORE). Hes now an employee of ours, not an owner of our company in any capacity. We did not know about the issues that that company had with Amazon, but the fact remains - we ARE NOT related to the company that one of our employees worked for!
So our inventory and account balance (tens of thousands of dollars) are being held hostage by Amazon. BUT Amazon will forgive any wrongdoing and reinstate BOTH accounts without any explanation necessary, as long as we pay THEIR outstanding balance of $27,500.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated, Im at a bit of a loss on where to go next.",Account Health

Thank you for talking with us about your selling account.
As we discussed, recent activity on your account violates Amazons Selling Policies and Seller Code of Conduct, and your account has been temporarily deactivated. At this time, funds will not be transferred to you but will stay in your account while we work with you to address this issue.
Why is this happening?
The Amazons Selling Policies and Seller Code of Conduct prohibit:
 any attempt to manipulate ratings.
 any attempt to manipulate feedback.
 any attempt to manipulate reviews.
 any attempt to manipulate sales rank.
 any attempt to misuse Amazon A-to-z guarantee.
How do I reactivate my account?
To reactivate your selling account, please submit a plan of action that describes:
 The methods used to obtain orders that violate Amazon selling policies including placing orders for your own products.
 A list of the orders placed in an attempt to manipulate sales or misuse the A-to-z guarantee.
 The steps you have taken to prevent sales manipulation going forward.
Ive filed POAs before without issue, but for this one I legitimately have no idea what they are talking about, which makes it pretty difficult to file a POA. There is nothing listed in their email that we have done, and of course Seller Performance doesnt actually tell you anything useful like see this order xxxxx, you shouldnt have done xxxx on this, or see listing xxx you cant do xxxx.
I liken this to the police arresting you, saying defend yourself and when you say from what? they say you know.
This account was getting on average just 1 order per day.
Account health told me that the problem would have been with something that happened within 30 days of receiving the notice from SP. All health metrics were perfect.
I went though all orders that occurred within 30 days and found only 2 things I thought Amazon may not like:
Our helpdesk autoresponder included a link to our website in 1 customer interaction.
We had one order that the customer asked for an address change. We canceled the order and asked the customer to create a new order with the correct address on it.
We didnt make any changes to any product listings in the prior 30 days (or longer most likely). We didnt send feedback request emails. We didnt ask anyone to write or change reviews. I have no idea how wed manipulate sales rank, and I dont know what misusing A-to-Z claims would even entail.
Further, and with all due respect, this is Amazon Canada, it was about 5% the business of our US account - why would be bother with any of these tactics for such minimal gain - it just doesnt make any logical sense.
After sending in a few POAs with no luck (mentioning the potential issues I found above), I even hired someone to audit our account for problems - they found nothing more than I did. They did write up a slightly more compelling POA than I had, but still with no luck, just the same canned responses from SP.
Now, Ill fully admit, my first POA was NOT helpful in that I accidentally said we had been using a feedback review email service, but when I double checked I noticed that we actually were not using that service at all on this account (nor any accounts after this scare). In subsequent appeals I pointed out this error - but after talking to Account Health, they made it sound like this was likely not the cause of the problem, but they also said they didnt know the cause of the problem.
So, were left to defend against something, of which Amazon themselves dont seem to know what the problem actually is, on an account with perfect health metrics.
It sounds to me like some bot flagged something on our account, but no one is able to figure out what, and SP is unable to communicate, so were left without an Amazon.ca account?",Account Health

1099,Account Deactivated Need Help,"Hello Everyone,
We received notification from amazon about account deactivation. I have pasted the notification below also our response.
Dear Seller,
Your Amazon Seller account has been permanently deactivated. Your listings have been removed from our site.
Why is this happening?
You have deceptively listed N95 or similar masks in our consumer store. This product type is currently restricted from sale on Amazon.com. Items sold on Amazon.com must adhere to all applicable laws and Amazons policies.
How do I reactivate my account?
To reactivate your selling account, please submit evidence or documentation demonstrating that your account has not violated our Restricted Products policy.
How do I send the required information?
To submit this information, please reply to this message. You may also visit the Performance Notifications page under the Performance section of your account, find this message, and click the Appeal button.
What happens if I do not send the required information?
If we do not receive the required information your account will remain deactivated and we may permanently withhold any payments to you. You can see your balance and settlement information in the Payments section of Seller Central. If you have questions about those, please send an email to payments-funds@amazon.com.
Our response:
Following is my plan of action in regards to our accounts reactivated.
Root cause: We listed our inventory under the listing that was advertised as KN95 masks. We are approved to sell under personal safety and house hold category (see attachment one) which allows listing of face mask. We are also aware that due to COV19 pandemic amazon is restricting the creation of new listing of face masks but due to that listing already being active on amazon.com with a lot of sellers on it, and had a lot of reviews we assumed that selling under those listings wouldnt be a problem because we are not creating a new listing but adding our inventory on an existing active listing. We were also aware that listing of N95 mask or similar mask were prohibited on amazon but based on our interpretation KN95 mask that we listed were non-medical, civil purpose mask as mentioned on each packaging (see attached pics of the packaging) and were more similar to the 3-ply civil mask or cloth mask that are allowed to be sold on amazon. We assumed that sale of KN95 was fine as long it was non-medical and for civil use. We are not approved to sell to front line organization like hospitals and law enforcement and neither did we intend to since it was non-medical grade KN95 mask. When we try to list KN95 mask the listing that is for civil purpose let us list (see attachment two) but if a listing makes medical claims or is claim it to be N95 replacement which makes it medical grade mask we cant sell on that listing since we are not approved to sell medical grade mask (see attachment three)
Action taken to resolve the issue in question is that we have deleted all our KN95 mask listings; Even though we are allowed to sell under personal safety and house hold category and allowed to list face masks. For the sake for our partnership and our sincere interest to be a long-term amazons selling partner we have proactively deleted all the KN95 mask listing and will not be listing KN95 mask in the future. We have also educated ourselves on Amazons policy in regards to face mask and other COV19 essential items. Under Mask and Respirators, we read all the information in regards to different masks and their requirements and applicable polices that govern them. We also educated our selfs by reading the pages on restricted products and listing restrictions in great details. We will be auditing our listing weekly to make sure they comply with amazons polices and applicable laws.",Account Health

1101,Account Deactivated after Barrage of Product Condition Customer Complaints - Review POA,"So here is goes. Like many of you we are struggling with all the COVID-19 related issues with one bright spot keeping the warehouse guys busy. I lot of people are buying Ski/Snowboard neck tubes/balaclavas due to CDC guidelines. This was not the reason we got deactivated though. We got a barrage of 16 policy violations over the weekend. 16 to be precise, our last one was in December and this is out of 55XXX orders, so it came as a shock. Has anyone received a sudden barrage of complaints like that out of nowhere? Seems strange.
Anyway we really need this reinstatement to keep people employed so any feedback would be appreciated. My main thesis is that it was due to damaged items from shipping as poor packaging can damage ski goggles in transit. See below.
 Greater detail on the root cause(s) of the policy violation
The root cause of the policy violation is that numerous orders had product condition complaints. I believe this is mainly in part due to problems with product packaging of the goggles on certain models. Mostly we have good voice of the customer ratings on those products however this is a new venue for us to spot trends where potential poor packaging can result in goggles arriving with scratches on the lens due to shipping and customers finding the product to be in used condition.
I believe this issue is caused primarily by
Poor packaging on certain products, namely the Smith and Scott Ski goggles that needs to be addressed.
The packaging causes goggle lenses to become scratched. We are going to improve the packaging.
 Greater detail on the actions you have taken to resolve ${policy/metric seller violated}issues
1) I will be requesting that our warehouse staff more closely inspect high end ski goggles for potential product packaging issues that could result in scratched lenses.
2) We will be requesting the retrieval of the problem ASINs and their inventory if they are at Amazon warehouses for inspection
 Greater detail on the steps you have taken to prevent the policy violation going forward
1) Furthermore since 2 of the problem ASINs were snow hardgoods that were sent to FBA warehouses, and are extremely sensitive to shipping we are going to not send in snowboards or bindings to Amazon warehouses as the base material has higher likelihood of scratches being shipped twice.
2) We are wrapping snowboards in polyurethane foam for protection during shipping to prevent the condition from being poor upon arriving to customers.
 Greater detail on how your account has complied with our policy
1) All orders for ski goggles today are being shipped today and henceforth with a notice on the packing slip that if there are scratches to the goggle lens then we will provide a free replacement to the customer.
 Greater detail on evidence or examples that demonstrate that your account has complied with our policy
1) I have attached a packing slip example with our message we are including to our customers on it that encourages to contact us in the case of product condition concerns. The remaining unshipped orders will be processed with this message.
2)We will be evaluating the problem SKUs for potential packaging issues and potentially wrapping items in additional plastic if particular models look vulnerable to scratches that could make the product look used",Account Health

Long story short, I ship salad dressing in bottles. I tried a new method of packaging that I thought would be sturdy enough, and it wasnt. I had a lot of bottles crack in shipping from FBA and got too many complaints all at once.
Ive since changed the packaging back, but Im not able to sell on Amazon as a result. I sell on my own personal website and fulfill with a 3PL and have suffered no damage with this new packaging.
Here are my latest appeal POA that was rejected
Additional information
 Greater detail on the root cause(s) of buyers receiving defective items.
The cap is the weak point on our bottles. Previous packaging used was susceptible to drop damage. On all drop tests, the cap broke and caused leakage from the bottles.
The number one complaint from damaged orders was of dressing leaking or seeping from the cap, caused by a cap failure.
Previous packaging only had minimal bubble wrap on neck of bottle.
The Bottle only had 1 layer of bubble wrap around neck of bottle, which did not adequately cover the cap. This caused bottles to be susceptible to breakage.
Bottles packaged in this manner were easily broken from drops or by pressure. Additionally, because the bottles were plastic, they were often placed in bubble envelopes, which could easily be crushed during shipping. With no rigid protection, stacking can crush the bottles.
Please see attached PDF for full diagram of packaging
 Greater detail on the steps you have taken to prevent buyers receiving defective items going forward.
Bottle will be wrapped in 3 ft of bubble wrap and then placed inside 9x3x4 box. This provides both cushion and rigid protection against drops, shock and crushing. This has passed multiple 6ft drop tests as required by FBA.
Note
This packaging was used previously with FBA and had no reported breakage during shipping.
Over 1,000 packages have been sent out using this method from sales on our website with no result of breakage to customer.
Please see attached PDF for full diagram of NEW packaging
 Greater detail on the actions you have taken to resolve buyers receiving defective items.
All buyers who have received defective or poorly packaged orders have been contacted through Amazons customer response portal. Additionally, many customers have reached out to our company through the 1-800 number on our bottles.
Any customers who has requested a refund has received one through Amazon. Any customer that has requested a replacement order has also received one.
I also included a 3 page PDF with actual pictures with detailed captions of the old packaging vs the new packaging.
Any idea what Im missing here? Is this just a resubmit it until you find someone who will approve it situation? Or do I need more details (which I honestly cant think of what else to include)

1108,Help with Account Deactivated in Error Appeal,"I am a very small hobby seller. I have been a Seller on Amazon almost from its inception. I just had to cancel an order because I could not find it in my inventory. This is the second cancellation in two weeks. This is almost unheard of for me. I was appalled that I had to do it but I simply could not find these books.
I had read on these forums cases of ghost inventory appearing for other sellers, so assuming that was happening to me, I decided to put my account on vacation and do a complete physical inventory.
When I went back to my Account Page to do this, I found a notice that my account had been deactivated. I immediately assumed that it was because my order defect rate was at more than 14 percent for two cancellations in less than two weeks.
However, upon reading my email, I found a letter saying that my account was found to be associated with another account. This simply cannot be true. I do not and never have had two accounts.
A long time ago, I do not remember exactly, but about ten years ago, I had a problem because my then partner had opened his own account and duplicated some of my merchandise. (I only sell books.) I explained the situation at the time to Amazon (I believe it was by writing to jeff@amazon.com, thats how long ago this was.) and my account at that time was reinstated. My partner did not try to appeal or to ever sell anything on Amazon again.
Recently, within the last four years, we got back together and he has been living here in the same house. He does not have an Amazons Seller Account, and we do not even use the same computer. He occasionally help mes package sales, etc. but only working from my computer.
That is the only thing that I can think of that would make Amazon think I am associated with a suspended account. I am just sick about this and frantic. I started writing in response to if you think this is an error appeal, but had second thoughts and decided to come here and hope that leveler heads would help. I am so upset I dont know that I am making myself clear. I really hate having to broadcast all this personal information, but I have been on Amazon for a long, long time and enjoy bookselling. Its just a hobby, but it means a lot to me. Any advice about how to word my letter to Amazon. I also received the same letter for an Amazon.ca account which I started but never used. Could that have anything to do with this?
Thank you for any advice you can give.

My appeal:
Hello Amazon,
On the 26th of April 2020, I was notified that our selling privileges have been removed due to listing items in our inventory that we are not permitted to sell on Amazon.com, listing items in categories that we are not allowed to sell in, and also listing items prior to having them in our possession. The ASINs for these products are the following:

I want to apologize and accept full responsibility for this because it is our responsibility to ensure that we comply with all of Amazons policies. I would like to use this appeal to inform Amazon of the action that I have taken, show the cause of how this happened, and give a full plan of action to ensure full compliance in the future.
I have carried out a full investigation into our operation to identify the cause of this and I have highlighted an issue in our system for handling performance notifications and the process for listing items. The issue has been not thoroughly inspecting listings, prematurely listing inventory that has not been purchased, and not checking selling eligibility in a category prior to listing/selling.
I would like to share our full plan of action to ensure the prevention of this in the future:
All listings mentioned above have been deleted from inventory with NO intent on relisting until approved in the category.
All inventory will be purchased prior to listing and an inventory spreadsheet has been created to ensure that all inventory in house matches inventory listed on Amazon.
All deleted and restricted ASINs have been immediately placed into a not permitted spreadsheet and a formula set up which will highlight any of these ASINs to all team members.
We have hired and instructed our research and purchasing personnel to check all items now and in the future for permissions to sell.
All notifications will be monitored on a continuous daily basis and actioned as per requirements immediately upon notification.
All amazon policies will be reviewed on a daily basis and listings will be updated to ensure continuous compliance.
We have applied for selling permissions in a few categories and will continue to apply in other categories to expand our selling capabilities
We have also applied with different wholesalers to ensure the proper receipt of all authentic items.
I would like to again apologize and accept full responsibility for this. We are fully committed to complying with Amazons standards and policies to ensure the safety of all Amazons customers and give them a great customer experience when purchasing with Amazon.
Thank you for your consideration in this appeal and your time that was taken today.
We look forward to hearing from you""",Account Health

1112,53 employees waiting for Seller Performance to respond since Friday. No updates or status. Help!,"This is ridiculous. I too, have been waiting since Friday for a response to my POA for price gouging. I do not price gouge. I repeat, I do not price gouge. I have 53 employees on staff, and we sell many items that can be classified as essentials. We have been doing so for years and have outstanding metrics. We were careful to make sure that no item goes above a small % of the max amount on our repricer. We made the corrections to lower it even further that on some items we are losing money.
Last month I did 3.2 million in sales. Everything is purchased from national distributors. I cannot survive too much longer without laying off workers. Each day is devastating, and Amazon refuses to respond. The so-called price gouging items have been long deleted.
Why does this take so long? Why suspend the entire account?
I have sent my POA as Amazon requests. After 36 ours, we got a denial that looked like a child had put it together. It was clearly copy/pasted from another message. There was a long list of ASINs that do not exist on my account. I have escalated to SAS Core. I DO have an SAS account manager who costs us $5,000 a month. No help at all.
How can a seller that does millions a month be suspended for literally nothing? What risk are we to the platform?",Account Health
1113,Seller Performance un-accepted an Appeal,"We received an Inauthentic complaint against an ASIN in mid-April. Within 24 hours, we received notice that the appeal was accepted. We had no other active cases at the time with Seller Performance.
Fast forward to today where the ASIN has a different issue. Opened a case and was told to appeal it again on our account health.
Appealed again and now our supplier, whom we have appealed over half a dozen items for, cannot be verified.
We buy from a distributor who buys from the manufacturer. We buy it by the case pack and sell as single units. Why did my appeal get un-accepted (I have all the emails) and why cant my supplier be suddenly verified? Our invoice has a phone number right on it. We sell roughly 100k units from this distributor annually and I am not being given clear and accurate answers from Seller Performance.
This is a standard inauthentic claim. I know how to appeal them. But Seller Performance backpedaling is now affecting our business.",Account Health
1114,"Prove Authenticity, but their trademark is pending cancellation","I had an ASIN removed due to trademark infringement several months ago. I manufacture this product and it has a decorative phrase printed on it, which matched the trademark claim. The claim holder was incorrectly granted their trademark and I hired a lawyer and and have filed with the USPTO to have their trademark cancelled.
Just a week or two ago I received a performance notice from amazon claiming that they are investigating my inventory and that I need to prove its authenticity. They requested invoices, supplier info, etc. The problem is that this ASIN was originally removed due to a trademark claim. The way to prove that its authentic would be to show that I am currently proceeding with legally have their trademark removed and am currently involved in a legal case thats been filed with the USPTO. I sent them the information and legal documents and they came back again asking for invoices and supplier info. How is any of that information going to prove my products are authentic? How do I get them to understand that that I am actively involved in cancelling their trademark? Whats the best path forward?",Account Health
1115,Order defect numbers are way off right now,"Does anyone know why the order defect numbers are way off this month? A few days ago my account showed my total orders in the 60 day window to be 135. Now it is only showing 13. My sales did not drop so the larger number should be the correct one. I am concerned, because if I get just 1 defect, it will make the percentage number 7.7%, which could get me closed down.",Account Health
1116,Inauthenticity complaint response to Amazon not being accepted despite providing what they ask for,"Amazon hit me me with a customer complaint about inauthenticty, the products are bought directly from the manufacturer warehouse. When asked fro proof by Amazon, I provided exactly what they asked for with invoices:
""Please send the following information for the items listed at the end of this email:
 Supplier information (name, phone number, address, website)  Buyer information (name, phone number, address, website)  Item descriptions (for ease of our review, you may highlight or circle the ASIN(s) under review)  Item quantities  Invoice date (must be issued in the last 365 days)""
But they said We received your submission but do not have sufficient information to reactivate your listings.
And said they would no longer be responding to emails about this case.
So, what do I do here? I have all the proof they asked for and the manufacturer is able to confirm we bought from them. What more can I do?",Account Health
1117,Hit with Anti-Counterfeiting listing removed!,"I received the following email from Amazon. Weve been an authorized dealer of this particular manufacturer for over 10 years and selling this item since it was first available. How is it that Amazon suddenly thinks were selling counterfeit merchandise? I have all of the documentation and proof needed, but Im curious how we get hit with something like this causing hours of unnecessary work and headaches. I might add, we ship this item directly from the manufacturer into the Amazon FCs. We sell them on Amazon and our own website, so use them for MCF orders too. Last point is that they listed the incorrect manufacturer of the item (Complete Medical). Its not made by this company they indicate in the email, but it is shown correctly on the Amazon.com 1 listing. Complete Medical sounds more like a seller name than a manufacturer.

1118,Sold an Used item but got an Used Sold as New Policy Violation,"Hi, we sold an used item, and yesterday we got an inauthenticity complaint from the Seller Performance Team. They only asked for invoices (no POA) for the appeal to reactivate my listing. Because there is no violation shown in Account Health, I replied directly to seller-performance-policy@amazon.com. A few minutes later, I got a reply from pq-product-review@amazon.com (dont know why), rejecting my appeal by saying I didnt tackle the Used Sold As New complaint.
I was frustrated as this item was clearly listed under used condition. In fact, weve never sold any brand new items under the ASIN. I emailed them back explaining the situation and asked them to remove this violation because it was unjustified. A few minutes later, I got a rejection email from them again.

This is my tentative Plan of action:
Root causes;
We received a deactivation notice regarding ten ASINs that were listed using purchased GS1 EAN numbers.
We also received 80 Suspected Intellectual Property Violation Notices, including the 10 ASINs noted above, for listing those products with purchased GS1 EAN numbers.
We Falsely believed we could list these products with purchased GS1 EAN numbers because the identifier directly on the items was an internal UPC specific to Target and was invalid when used for creating a catalog page with the Add a Product Tool on Amazon.
Received C9 Champion Suspected Intellectual Property Violations on 3/6/2020 and did not respond in the time required per policy.
Actions taken to resolve the issue
The C9 Champion products cited in violation have been removed from Amazon.
All C9 Champion products have been removed from our inventory.
The staff who create our catalog pages have been required to reread Intellectual Property Policy for Sellers along with all the Frequently Asked Questions.
I have arranged a consult with a local copyright attorney to educate myself.
Created a company policy that all notices of violations must be responded to within 2 days.
Steps taken to prevent the issue going forward.
All staff will receive in-service education on the Intellectual Property Policy for Sellers. Our company will repeat this education annually.
All staff will receive an in-service education for Branding products on Amazon for the purpose of education regarding the use of EAN numbers.
Company policy will mandate the monitoring of the Inactive inventory list so issues regarding products/catalog pages can be resolved quickly.
Company policy will adjust to require all administrators to check Account Health twice a day.
Respond to violation notices per Amazon policy rather than allow an issue to progress to the more serious step of deactivation. I sincerely apologize for that misstep on my part.
Humbly request reactivation of our account.
I would very much appreciate input before I have to send this in, which is tomorrow (Thursday 3/26)",Account Health

Hello Amazon Seller Performance Team
I understand that Amazon takes complaints about violations of intellectual property rights of brand or rights owners very seriously and i would like to share with you my Plan of Action in which i explain what i have done to resolve the issue and what will i do to prevent similar complaints of happening in the future
What happen :
-I received an Intellectual Property Complaint for rights owner for the :
ASIN: B085QLJR3H
Title: 50 pcs Disposable Mouth Cover
Infringement type: Counterfeit
Complaint ID: 6908464721
I take full responsibility for these IP complaints.
A :The root cause of the problem INAUTHENTICITY complaint:
( 1 ) : I purchased these products through retail sources instead of directly from authorized brand manufacturers or distributors. I have not followed up with
brands to ensure authorization to resell these items on Amazon.
( 2 ) : We acknowledge that we no have inadequate knowledge and education of amazons marketplace selling policies concerning trademarks and rights owners IP.
(3) : I was unable to provide Amazon with requested invoices or other documentation from authorized suppliers or distributors of these items. I was only able to provide receipts from the following retailers: ASIN: B085QLJR3H
(3a) : I was unable to provide Amazon with requested brand authorization from the rights owners in order to prove evidence of valid supply chains for the items listed on these ASINs.
( 4 ) : We did not address the seller performance notifications we received; mistakenly believing that deleting the listing(s) was a sufficient response.
B. Actions taken to resolve the issue with the rights owner
( 1 ) : I have removed ASIN: B085QLJR3H from my inventory and will never relist it again.
( 2 ) : We sent emails explaining the situation. Make an apology and a plan will never break. But no feedback from email recipients
( 3 ) : I have very carefully read a few times all the amazon policies, especially the ones concerning the proper ways to source inventory and Amazon Anti-Counterfeiting policy to ensure that I will not violate them again. At the link I have found : https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html?itemID=201361070 2
and link : https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/201165970
( 4 ) : In the last few days, I have had my staff go over each and every listing on my account to make sure that we do not infringe on any Amazon Policy and that our listings comply 100% with Amazon Policies
C. Steps taken to prevent future complaints about product AUTHENTICITY:
( 1 ) : I have reviewed Amazons policies regarding authenticity and IP complaints.
(1.a ) : I retained professional legal assistance through my IP attorney, who has reviewed all mylistings to ensure there are no other infringing issues that I have overlooked
( 1.b ) : Before listing new items, my attorney will conduct Intellectual Property searches to prevent anyand all future infringement, including trademark search and patent search
( 1.c ) : In addition, I retained an Amazon Compliance consultant, that will provide continuous Amazonpolicy support. This includes guidance for my listing and selling procedures and reviewing newAmazon policies as they are updated
( 2 ) : Going forward, all our inventory will be sourced only from reliable sources either directly from manufacturer or authorized distributors, who will be able to provide me with valid invoices meeting Amazon requirements.
( 3 ) : For our future sources, I have asked all of them to give us invoices to comply with Amazon policies.
( 4 ) : I will contact vendors and brands in advance to obtain authorization and confirm that we can sell on amazon.
( 5 ) : I will read regularly and re-read the Amazon Policies and guidelines to make sure that I am not in violation of any rules. Also, I will be on the lookout for all changes in policies or any applicable laws, which might affect me or my account react proactively.
I believe that I have fixed the root cause of the intellectual property rights complaint, and that I haveput in place standards of best practice to prevent any issues in the future
Selling on Amazon represents the livelihood of my family, and I would NEVER intentionally put myselfat risk of losing that privilege. In all future cases I will take the utmost care to meticulously examine allimages and marketing materials to ensure that they are entirely my own. Thank you very much for thisopportunity to be a compliant Amazon seller
I respectfully seek approval of the above Plan of action and the reinstatement of my account.
Once again, thanks for taking the time to review my appeal and I am looking forward to continue selling on Amazon
Sincerely

1125,New seller account deactivated because of global marketplace misstep?,"Hello,
I believe Ive made a mess during the sign up process. After the initial suspension from the new seller registration (as professional seller). I had provided all necessary documents such as internet paper bill, credit card statements and others via 3 times of appeals and resubmits. The results were the usual auto-reply emails from Amazon of do not have enough information unable to verify the document(s) Ive followed everything as instructed. Made sure the name and the address on all provided documents are the same and match to the business address and my own name. I felt so lost and helpless, until I googled up where someone had mentioned in the forum here about the global marketplace could be the culprit
I did indeed chose yes to add global marketplace option when signing up the US seller account. Naively, I didnt think this would create separate different seller accounts. Later Ive confirmed the registration process for the EU and JPN region so their status are no longer in pending. I also changed all the contact emails for the accounts to my business email. Long story short now my NA region seller account has became deactivated instead of suspended. I dont know if this is the auto account deactivation because of my actions. I have never sold anything on Amazon and I intended to sell on USA only for now. I wanted to rectify the mistake so I also changed other non-NA region accounts to to inactive listing (holiday setting) and downgrade them to individual seller level.
Now the EU seller performance status is:
. Your account is being verified
The JPN seller performance status seems ok, no banner or anything.
I know this might sounds like Ive done too many unnecessary steps to reach into this situation But what should I do now? Should I link the accounts? or should I close all other non-NA region accounts? I wish there is an actual human being from Amazon to help me out for this.
Thanks for reading.",Account Health
1126,"Its been 40 days without a response to my appeal, meanwhile creditcard keeps getting charged","Hi guys, Im posting here because I dont know what to do anymore.
I signed up early march, got charged $50 and deactivated immediately. They needed verification of who I am (they needed a utility bill), so I appealed two times including an utility bill. Each time I got a response the day after that didnt really make sense. So after getting help from the forums here I sent in another appeal hoping this would the one that would go through.
That last appeal was on 2 april, so more than 40 days ago, and I have still not gotten a response. Meanwhile the second monthly payment of $50 has been charged.
So Im paying $50 per month for something I havent used for one second and maybe never will be able to use.
What do I do? If I cancel the account, Im out $100. If I keep waiting, I might be waiting forever.

1127,Been a Month - No response from Seller Performance,"Does anyone know how long it takes for Seller Performance to respond?
We appealed on May 1st and then sent another detailed one on May 4th and have not heard back.
Our main account (this account #1) was deactivated because Amazon detected that it was related to another account (account #2) that was not allowed to sell (Account #2 was going under Identity Verification).
We started the second account because Amazon Executive Relations Team informed us that they didnt think the technical team would be able to restore our 1st account and told us we should just open another one - which we did. We used the same information as the 1st account, assuming that the 1st account had disappeared from Amazons database.
A week later, we are informed that the 1st Account was able to be restored after 2 months! We were so relieved. However, Amazons Bot takes down the 1st account a few days later, telling us that it was related to Account #2.

I recently listed a product for FBA and before checked to see if there were similar products with ASINS (as Amazon tells you to do) while logged on to Amazon as well as on their official app.
I saw there was an made an offer on an existing ASIN.
About a week later I got a complaint but the person who had the ASIN created that I was selling counterfeit products. These are generic face shields that are listed in hundreds of other ASINS on Amazon. The complainant is even using the same photos from the other listings of this generic item. I am sure he has no property ownership over this item.

----end of amazon notice-------
i wrote 2 POA already, both of them got rejected within an hour. If someone can help me I would really appreciate it.
------my appeal letter-------
Dear Product Compliance,
We have received notification that our account has been suspended due to us listing
items on amazon that are not permitted for sale. We have written, and actioned a
plan of action below, including the root cause of the violation, how we have resolved
this and how we will prevent further violations going forward.
Root Causes of Violation;
We understand that due to Covid-19 pandemic, you have increased your controls on
new product listings for certain Personal Safety and Household products, such as
disposable face masks, hand sanitizers, disinfecting wipes and sprays, isopropyl
alcohol, and related products.
We have been advised that N95 or similar masks are not currently permitted for sale
on Amazon.com, and that it appears that we have deceptively listed these items.
When we listed this item, we matched listed against an ASIN that appeared to be
matching the product we were offering for sale. We did not intentionally deceive
amazon.
We now understand that the listing violated your Product detail page by using, but
not exclusively, Ma sks, Msks, and s instead of Masks, by using bold letters,
and by miscategorizing the product. This was not a listing that we created, we
mistakenly listed on this existing listing.
I would like to emphasise that I fully understand Amazons policy regarding all
prohibited listings on Amazon, and can assure you that these items are not
prohibited.
Details of the proactive steps we taken to resolve any issues;
All listings of products that are restricted have been removed/closed, and will not
be relisted.
We do not wish to sell any face masks on Amazon going forward.
Details of the proactive steps we taken to ensure there are no listings of
restricted/prohibited items on Amazon;
We will only list and sell items that are compliant with Amazons policies. We
understand that Amazon policy prohibits the sale of certain products.
We have rechecked our inventory to check all items, and ensure all items that we
wish to sell are compliant with Amazons policy on prohibited items.
We understand that we are responsible for ensuring that our listings comply with
all laws, regulations and amazons policies, and that these can change.
We will regularly update our knowledge to stay informed on these policies as we
understand that these laws, regulations and policies are often changing, and differ
from the different market places.
We understand we are responsible for ensuring that the products we offer for sale
are legal and authorized for sale, and comply with all laws, and that these laws differ
from marketplace to marketplace.
I can assure Amazon that I have taken note of, and will make sure we work to the
following policies and guidelines;
Prohibited Seller Activities and Actions
Product Detail Page Rules
Condition Guidelines
We fully understand that we had listed prohibited items on Amazon and after a full
review of our inventory and the amazon terms and conditions; we have removed
these items and put in place a sufficient process/systems to prevent any prohibited
items from being listed in the future.
I assure you that we have resolved all the issues in relation to restricted/prohibited
items and have now implemented controls to prevent future issues.
If you have any queries or need any further information, please do not hesitate to
contact me.

1132,Suspension Appeal help needed,"Im at a loss. Im not a wordy person and can not for the life of me figure out what more they need to hear. Ive been selling on AZ for 11 years or so. I was suspended for price gouging with face masks and hand sanitizer. I have never sold them before but jumped on the bandwagon to make some money. I sold them before a state of emergency was declared and honestly didnt think there was a shortage, just a bunch of people on the west coast willing to pay a lot for stuff that I could buy at any store I walked into. At the time I was pretty hard up for money and thankful for the much needed influx into what normally would be my worst selling month. Ive submitted 3 appeals, each one gets the same response back, I dont know what else to add.
Policy violation: Fair Pricing Abuse on 3 items, 2 are masks, one sanitizer.
My last appeal to them-
Appeal Policy violation: Fair Pricing Abuse
1. Root Cause of the Issue:
ASIN: B* Coconut & Lime Scented Hand Sanitizer Anti-bacterial hand gel 3oz
ASIN: B* 3M Drywall Sanding Respirator, N95
ASIN: B* 3M Chemical Odor Valved Respirator, 2-Pack
We were selling items (respirators and sanitizers) for higher than MSRP prices. These items were new inventory for us and we were not familiar with historical pricing on Amazon and other marketplaces. The research we did showed the current marketplace prices to be the same as our prices or higher on all other sites we checked. We failed to do the proper research necessary before listing them on Amazon to ensure our prices were and continued to be compliant with Amazons Fair Pricing Policy.
The listing and sales were done before a State of Emergency was declared on March 13. We honestly thought we were providing a service to customers in other states that could not find items that we could readily find in every store we went to.
We use a repricer and failed to set maximum prices that would ensure our pricing didnt violate Amazons Fair Pricing Policy. Items were selling so fast we didnt take time to look at prices, just shipped and restocked as fast as possible.
We were depending on the Amazon High Pricing error deactivation feature to temporarily suspend listings, which didnt happen.
In summary I did not fully grasp the gravity of the situation and the true shortages in the marketplace when pricing these select products and failed to use due diligence when setting prices.
2. Steps we have taken already:
We deleted all reported and related ASINs as soon as we were notified of our errors. Oddly enough, the appeals we submitted still say that those ASINs are overpriced even though they were immediately deleted from inventory.
We have reviewed the Fair Pricing: https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/62551 1 and The Seller Code of Conduct https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html?itemID=G1801&language=en_US and shared it with everyone who works with us.
We have set our repricers so that it will not raise the price more than 10% over a 30 day period, so they will not follow the crowd when prices move so quickly upward.
We have checked each item on our repricer and ensured that a reasonable maximum has been set to avoid overpricing.
We have reviewed our entire inventory to compare our prices with prices offered on other marketplaces such as Walmart.com, ebay.com, google.com and historical price sites www.camelcamelcamel.com and www.keepa.com to ensure our current listings follow Amazons Fair Pricing Policy.
We will no longer depend on the Amazon Pricing error deactivation feature.
3. Changes we are making to ensure this doesnt happen in the future:
We will no longer list items on Amazon until we are completely assured that our pricing complies with Amazon Fair Pricing Policy and have reviewed Keepa https://keepa.com/ 3 and Camel https://camelcamelcamel.com/ for historical pricing data and google.com, walmart.com for current prices.
We have reviewed all of our inventory for other pricing errors. I will continue to personally monitor our pricing, and will review pricing on a daily schedule.
When creating new listings, we currently and will continue to review historical data on Keepa https://keepa.com/ 3 and Camel https://camelcamelcamel.com/ and current data on www.google.com and www.walmart.com 1 to ensure that our prices are consistent with market pricing and our maximum price will not rise more than 10% in a 30 day period.
I have posted copies of the Amazon Seller Code of Conduct and Amazon Fair Market Price Policy on the bulletin board as a daily reminder to all of us.
I have deleted all shipping profiles and left only the Free Shipping profile so as not to violate the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy on excessive shipping fees unknowingly.
I believe these actions have brought and will keep our account into compliance with the totality of the Fair Pricing Policy, not just the aspects brought to our attention.

1133,SUSPENDED Account- Related Accounts issue - Different CASE - HELP!,"Hello everyone, I would like to describe you my current account situation.
1) On May 10, 2020, I made the decision to open an account on Amazon. At the very beginning I created an account on amazon US for buyers on the email address XXX. Moments later I realized that this is not this site so I went to seller central and there I created a seller account on the same email XXX.
Couple hour later I received below email:
2) On May 11, I wanted to log in to seller central US, but a page appeared with information go to the European marketplace and below go to Japan marketplace. Not knowing what this might cause, I clicked on both windows. Couple minutes later I got below email from each market ( US,Mexico, Canada, UK, DE, ES, IT, FR). It wasnt GLOBAL SELLING method.
After that I got another email from each marketplace ( US,Mexico, Canada, UK, DE, ES, IT, FR)
3) HOWEVER, the email from the JP market looked a bit different
4) Some time later, funds were withdrawn from my bank account for the account in the US and separately for the EU account - 49 $ and 30 Pounds. It is also a confirmation that I didnt fill Gobal Selling method (then it would take only one $39 ), but I activated these markets on a different way.
5) I called Amazon support a few times and they said that I should go through the verification on each of these accounts, i.e. from JAPAN to the US. I read the same here on the forum, but most of these problems concerned global selling, where I did not fill this method of selling.
6) At the moment I have only sent the required documents to the JP market. In addition, on the US and EU market I can only make POA with appeal - I did not receive any email what documents should I send them. Therefore, I have not sent any appeals yet, because I am waiting for the account to be unlocked on JP market.
7) If I wont be able to unlock JP account, can I ask to delete it? (I do not want to have an account on it and I will not sell there). However, I am little bit afraid by deleting the account on JP, because I can do even more damage on my account - thats right ?
What do you think about my case ? What should I do next ? Just wait ? Should I appeal on EU market with POA to unclock my account righ now, even if my JP account is incative or just wait for approval from JP side ?

1136,"Trademark Owner Claim Retraction, Plan of Action and Account Reactivation","Context: We are a manufacturer of products and retail them across several platforms, Amazon included. One of these products included a trademarked phrase in the title of its listing on Amazon. The phrase is not contained on the bottle or in any other part of the listing sans title. We received a claim and deleted the listing. Unfortunately, the performance notification was not removed and this eventually ended up in an account suspension. We have submitted four plans of action, each one embodying the Cause/Solution/Prevention formula and have tried to keep things short and sweet. On top of this, the trademark rights owner has submitted retractions of their claim numerous times, but to little avail there. Each time we receive a plan of action response (denied of course so far) there is a slight variation but the same general request for More detail. Now, having had several conversations with Account Health Specialists theyve always told us theyre not actually looking for more detail and they only have so many responses to choose from.

""Your Amazon.com Seller account has been temporarily deactivated. Your listings have been removed. Funds will not be transferred to you but will stay in your account while we work with you to address this issue. Please ship any open orders to avoid further impact to your account.
Why is this happening?
Your Amazon seller account has been deactivated in accordance with section 3 of Amazons Business Solutions Agreement.

How do I send the required information?
To reactivate your account, please visit account heath (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/performance/dashboard 1) and click on the Reactivate My Account button to submit necessary information.""
The background is this - I really violated the policy of the Amazon platform. I asked 10 of my friends to order from me, to increase the sales rating. After that, the account was deactivated. Next, I filed the following appeal:
The root cause of the issue
I carefully looked and studied the case. As I can see, unfortunately, I violated the Amazon policy. The main problem is caused by improper use of the sales rating and the search and viewing of violations.
After a full investigation of the situation, I noted the following:
Order (There is a transfer of numbers 10 orders) were made by my friends to increase the sales rating. Also, these people used contextual words in the search.
The actions you have taken to resolve the issue
I have carefully read Prohibited Seller Activities, the complete policies and agreement section. The actions above were in violation of Misuse of Sales Rank, Misuse of Feedback, Ratings, or Reviews. I confirm that I have read and agree to this policy.
I understand that buyers want honest sales. Therefore, from now on I will not manipulate the sales rating.
I have made sure the listings to make sure they are in compliance with Amazons policies. I have read Using Search Terms effectively to better optimize and correctly.
I removed the goods from the listing so that in no case would the rating of my products be undeservedly high.
The steps you have taken to prevent the issue going forward
I will clearly control the quantity and products that I have on sale.
I will use keywords more correctly in the search.
I will create my honest and competitive sales strategy, which will not violate the current rules of the Amazon platform.
All of the above can help ensure that my account meets Amazon policies.
Im sorry to break Amazons rules. I carefully read the agreements, and now I understand everything well. Thanks, have a nice day.
We received your submission but do not have enough information to reactivate your account at this time.
How do I reactivate my account?
To reactivate your account, please send the following:
 The names, email addresses, physical addresses, and/ or phone numbers of any third parties involved in this activity.
 Copies of all written communications with third parties involved in this activity.
 Evidence of payments made to any third parties involved in this activity.
 A description of how you learned about the third parties and how you each conducted activities.
Next, I wrote the phone numbers of the names and mailing addresses of my friends:
I thought for a long time how to increase sales faster. After that, I decided to attract my friends and acquaintances to increase the sales rating and strengthen contextual words in order to improve the search for my products.
We met in person to discuss the course of action. We decided to do it as follows:
My friends will create new customer accounts on the Amazon platform.
Then they will order the products that I sell through the search bar on the Amazon platform.
Therefore, we cannot provide you with copies of our conversations by mail.
Payment of my goods through personal credit cards. After I received the money, I would transfer it back.
I have read the Amazon policy sections and the sections Improper use of search and browse and Improper use of sales rating and I fully understand why we have a violation of the sales and search and viewing ratings. I will no longer instruct potential buyers to purchase my product with the search terms. I accept full responsibility for my actions. Please consider reinstating my account and I will never make this mistake in the future.
And 5 minutes after sending this letter, a letter came from Amazon, where they first duplicated their first letter to me! What does it mean? Is this an automatic response, or have Amazon employees checked my message in 5 minutes? What should I do next?(",Account Health
1138,How could this seller still be allowed to sell on Amazon with 98% negative feedback,"Ive read quite a few seasoned sellers with good seller metrics posting here about account being suspended for the smallest infraction.

They apologized and removed the feedback. But now I have to address the authenticity claim. Do I send Amazon the email chain with the other business?

1140,"Restricted Parent, but not children, seller support is confused","So, we sell bodywash items, and have for a while. With the COVID category reshuffle our Body Wash was moved by Amazon to the Body Oil category. This impacted our sales, so after a few weeks we requested a move back to the Body Wash category from seller support. We asked for two variation familes to be moved back to Body Wash.
What seems to have happened next was the parent ASIN for each product category was immediately marked as restricted as soon as it was transferred to the body wash category. However the child variation in each parent family was put into some sort of limbo without a category and was not restricted, just the parent ASIN.
We cannot get a clear answer from seller support if it is ok to list and sell the child items while the parent item is restricted.
If we just ask is it ok to sell ASIN xxxxx and xxxxx and xxxxx, they say Sure looks good but if we mention BTW the parent is restricted then they get confused and cant give an answer.
This is our current saga with Seller Support:
ASIN PARENT-XXXX has been identified as a restricted product, this is a body wash that should not be making any restricted claim.
The parent listing was restricted and we are able to sell the child items, however we assume that having a parent restricted means we should not be selling the child items, so we have closed the child items as well.
Were asking for you to look into it and approve this item for sale as it is a personal hygiene soap, not any sort of medical/anti bacterial soap.
We are attaching photos of the product as well as an invoice
ASIN/FNSKU: P-XXXXXXXX
Hello from Amazon Selling Partner Support,
We understand you are having issues with ASIN: P-XXXXXXX. Please note that this ASIN is a Variation Parent. This means that it is not visible on Amazon and cannot have any offers. The listings will be variation children for this product.
Additional information on Parent ASIN listings: The product listing is a non-buyable entity used to relate child products. The listing displayed only in the Seller Centrals search results. Amazon catalog uses the parent listing to establish relationships between the child products. For example, if 2 shirts have the same parent, then they are related and are considered child products.
Hello, can you explain why we got a performance notification about ASIN P-XXXXXXXXX?
I will copy and paste the relevant part here:
We are writing to let you know that the following detail pages have been removed from our catalog:

Is P-XXXXXXX (parent) no longer flagged as a restricted item?
Is it ok to list and sell:

C-XXXXXXXX
C-XXXXXXXX
C-XXXXXXXX
C-XXXXXXXX
Please clarify for us, thank you.
( One week break with 2 updates saying they are looking it it)
Thank you for your interest in selling P-XXXXXXXX on Amazon. As per our Internal Team, ASIN "" P-XXXXXXX "" is restricted as it has a bad detail page since there is no sufficient information about the product.
Hence, we advise you to update the detail page with bullet points, product descriptions, and images so that our Internal Team will review for possible reinstatement.
The review period generally takes 2-4 business days but it may take longer depending on the type of product. Once a product is determined to be permitted, it will be immediately made available for sale.
Although Amazon is undertaking this review, sellers are responsible for ensuring that the products they list on Amazon.com comply with all applicable laws.
Hello, ASIN P-XXXXXXX is a parent listing, earlier on this was said to us:
We understand you are having issues with ASIN: P-XXXXXXXXX. Please note that this ASIN is a Variation Parent. This means that it is not visible on Amazon and cannot have any offers. The listings will be variation children for this product.
Additional information on Parent ASIN listings: The product listing is a non-buyable entity used to relate child products
But we have gone ahead and copied over some info from the child listings to the parent listing. Please check again.
I understand your concern with regards to
In order to help our customers better find the products they need during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have increased our controls on new product listings for certain Personal Safety and Household products, such as gloves, soap, paper products, thermometers, and related products.

With this in mind, we have restricted the products listed above for review.
Hi, just to clarify, this is under active review at the moment? Or do we need to do something on our end?
I understand your concern that you want us to reinstate the inactive ASIN: P-XXXXXXXXX
To help you in this case we have contacted the concerned department and they have informed us that in order to help our customers better find the products they need during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have increased our controls on new product listings for certain Personal Safety and Household products, such as gloves, soap, paper products, thermometers, and related products.

Dear Seller,
Based on our records, you may have product listings that were removed due to non-compliance with Amazons Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy. When we originally removed your product listings, we shared that you could appeal for listing reactivation through your Account Health Dashboard on Seller Central. We are writing to inform you that we have updated the process for reactivating your product listing(s), and you no longer need to submit an appeal or wait for a decision from a previously submitted appeal to have these products relisted. We have updated the process for reactivating the following ASINs:
New Process for reactivating your listings:
In the Inventory section of Seller Central, select Manage Inventory.
Search for the ASIN or offer in question, or select Fix Stranded Inventory.
Edit the inactive ASIN or offer by updating the product information.
Save and finish.
I reviewed listings and replied this email, wherein I asked for further procedures. Now listings-evaluation@amazon.com sent email to me that my appeal was unsuccessful and I need to submit greater detail to sort things out.

1145,Used Sold as New POA,"I had a listing deactivated for Used Sold as New. This is the first time I have dealt with this issue. I have read all of @Shelf_Cleaning_Capits guide on handling these, but have some questions and I am hoping for feedback on my POA, and in general.
This was a three DVD self-defense training box set. ASIN: B000PW9W3Y. Two of the three discs came loose in transit and were scratched (the third one was returned still in the packaging). A piece of the plastic clip that holds the disc in place broke on one, causing the disc to go loose (pic below). The second one is not broke, but apparently it just doesnt hold very good.
This set was brand new still in the packaging, bought directly from an authorized supplier of the manufacturer of the DVD.
From what I can tell this deactivation was triggered exclusively by one return request. There were no other complaints or returns for this item. The return request states: 2 discs arrived loose and badly scratched
My first question is: where do I appeal this and send my POA and invoice?
Amazon tells me this:
How do I send the required information?
To send us the above information, please visit your Account Health Dashboard (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/performance/dashboard) in Seller Central and click on the appeal link next to the impacted ASIN.
But I cannot find this ASIN listed under the performance section of my dashboard anywhere.
My second question is: am I supposed to copy paste the entire notification from Amazon into my POA? It says so in @Shelf_Cleaning_Capits tutorial, but not in Amazons notification. I want to make sure I am not misunderstanding that part.

1147,An open letter to the executive team - Wrongful IP Warning,"To whom it may concern,
This is really getting out of hand. One of our vendors, filed a complaint against some un-authorized sellers, and claim that they included a list of authorized sellers. However it seems that amazons performance dept. that is based overseas is unable to tell the difference between left and right. Therefore they have gone ahead and delisted our product offering along with a bunch of other authorized dealers.
Along with the delisting, amazons ill-trained performance team has refused to recognize in the proof that we provided 3 times. First we provided just an invoice as proof, because that is all we had, then we procured a letter of authorization from the USA branch of the company.
Unfortunately, that is still being deemed as insufficient, and we are being faced now with a threat of deactivation from the ill-trained performance team.
I dont know, if you realize what kind of toll it takes on sellers to be faced with dealing with such poorly trained amazon employees, that have the ability to take away our and other 3PL sellers livelihood, with the click of a button. This is the digital equivalent, of what is happening in some places in the world where children are being given weapons to kill innocent villagers.
You all should think logically and humanely, as to how these actions affect our collective health, and the liabilities that we in turn carry our vendor, creditors and debtors.",Account Health

Thank you.
Dear byterunner,
We removed some of your listings because of customer complaints about items listed at the end of this email. Customers may be complaining because the items they received did not accurately match the condition or description of the product mentioned in the product detail page of your listings.
Why did I receive this message?

Products listed in new condition are expected to arrive in brand new, unopened condition with no signs of damage or wear. If customers receive a product that does not match this description, it may lead them to perceive the item as being previously opened or used.

Complaint Type ASIN Title Additional Information
Used Item Sold as New B07TX2DJMQ 1 Inch Diameter Clear PVC Schedule 40 Pipe, 2 Feet (24 Inches) Long [Pipe ID approximately 1.029 inch]
Here is my POA:
I have received a noticiation from Amazon requesting a plan of action that addresses a Used Sold As New complant against ASIN #B07TX2DJMQ.
I have thoroughly researched this, and can only find one return request for this item, and no other
complaints or messages regarding it. I believe that it is just this one order which is the issue.
The customer comment on the return request was,package was open small scratch. This item doesnt
have any product packaging, it is just a piece of pipe. So, I believe what he meant by this was that the
shipping container was damaged in transit, and the pipe sustained a small scratch as a result, even
though the pipe was encased in foam padding in an effort to protect it.
The issue(s) that led to the complaints about the product condition or description of your item.
The customer received a piece of pipe which was damaged in transit and sustained a small scratch.
The steps you have taken to prevent future complaints about the condition of your items.
We are adding additional padding and using additional tape to make it even more resistant to damage in
transit.
The steps you have taken to prevent future complaints about the condition of your items.
We always provide products that match the Amazon condition listed and strive to describe our products
on Amazon as accurately as possible. Any time anything arises that we find could be clearer, we always
update the listing to reflect it. As best I can tell, this issue was solely caused because the item was
damaged in transit.
Is this sufficient do you think? (along with the requested invoices from the manufacturer, etc.) I just dont know of much more to say, the item was reportedly very slightly damaged in transit. I provided the customer a full refund without requesting a return of the slightly scratched pipe.",Account Health

Is my Amazon Sales life over?",Account Health
1161,Our account was Suspended due to FedEx losing our shipment. How can our account be reinstated?,"We recently had 2 separate items, which were the same item, but different orders, which were or became A-Z claims
Both were Bose LSPS Speakers, for the Bose LIfeStyle Music System. Typically these are $400, we listed ours some $150 less, because these items do not sell and we have had these on the shelf for more than a year and no sales.
Customer one, places order, order is filled, shipped and arrives ahead of schedule. Customer paid standard shipping rates, which of course, this being a 30""x25""x 12"" weighing some 44lbs, the Amazon rate was well below what we had to pay. So they got some extra commission money from that order, for sure, because we had to dig into our revenue to cover these cost Customer stated item does not work, now keep in mind, only a person, replacing components would be, ordering this. Because, well nothing else works with this item, except the complete system. There are some 15 connection wires to this system, any one of which, having a short, could cause this item to fail. There are also 2 major electrical devices, both of which, have sensitive electrical components. There is one external power supply, which we have had cases of these failing All in all, lots of potential issues
We tested this item, some 3 weeks before it sold. We sold a complete Bose LifeStyle 35 system, then listed our other LifeStyle Systems, as parts, far below list price, because it is cheaper to break these down and ship them individually, than worry with selling complete systems and people, just are no in the market for complete systems, our experience so the item was tested, we know it worked, because we tested the item, using functioning components from the list that sold
So we knew, the mistake or issue, was not our product
Customer request a return, stated Item does not work so we request more information, what has been tested, what the Customer knew about the item, etc
NO RESPONSE
Customer Opens an A-Z claim and is instantly Awarded the claim and Claim goes against us At the same time, no time to resolve no time have the Customer respond to our information request, nothing Keep in mind, this item cost $60 to ship So the Customer answering a few question, seems reasonable
We appeal the decision Amazon refuses to reverse their decision
A second Customer, orders the same item, Bose LSPS Speaker, we package and ship the item. Shipment was delayed a few days, due to Thanksgiving, because we had to find the time to take item to FedEx Item was taken to FedEx and dropped off ( we do not ship items daily, so we cannot arrange for FedEx to pickup orders, because they only will schedule pickups if labels purchased using our Business account and not Amazon Labels) So we took the item to FedEx and dropped the item off, as we have done with packages for 15yrs? 3weeks later, we get a message Where is my Order? We review the tracking information, item was never scanned in? We tell the Customer to wait for a Couple of days and we will know more, and we will respond. This is on Friday so of course, any Office at FedEx that we need to contact is closed, by the time we get around to calling . The weekend, this office did not seem to be open either Now again, this is the weekend and we do answer emails and questions on the weekend, however, we do not have dedicated time to spend, working over the weekend Because, it is going to be at least an hour to deal with Customer service, no matter who it is Now keep in mind, FedEx was contracted by Amazon Also keep in mind, Amazon double bills for all labels We were charged some $30 and the label was incorrect, we had the weight incorrect, because the LSPS is much heavier than the Comparable Bose speaker or Acoustimass speaker. Which is where we were deriving our weight calculations They auto adjust this, not a big deal So if we were billed $30, most likely Amazon was billed, something like $13We had an incident where an item was not delivered in the past, we had to do the whole dog/tail thing, come to find out, we could not be refunded shipping, because Amazon purchased the label (Amazon does not have a department to handle refunding shipping, when labels are purchased, items are shipped, but either their address information is incorrect or the driver does not deliver the package Which is also great.) So we also learned, Amazon paid $12 for the label and that would be all they could refund us However, we were billed $25 for that same label and FedEx said, NO WAY, they would refund us, the extra money So Amazon, not helping that is super
Anyways, we call the Kinkos where the item was dropped off They review the video, find the day and time, we dropped off the item but they cannot find where the item was scanned in Oh, did I mention, the package never entered the FedEx system? Oh, well it didnt Great, I know! So, we attempt to file a claim We cannot do so Amazon purchased the Label So we call Amazon, who of course tells us ""We do not have a dedicated department to address this and we need to file a claim, with FedExThough, we already stated, we cannot so do, because FedEx dont deal with 3rd parties, who did not purchase the Label Keep in mind, by this time, the Customer filed an A-Z claim and was also, instantly awarded a refund and an A-Z claim was filed against us Again, this is still, only Monday We spent the Weekend calling the store, calling FedEx, then again on Monday, Tuesday, and a couple times, after this Which again, each call, takes 30min at min, the 800# that is going to be and Hour, because you have to tell them the problem a couple times, be transferred a couple of times, etc It is all great So now We are out the item cost plus the shipping cost plus an A-Z claim and an account suspension, follows Great right? I know
So finally, FedEx agrees to process a claim After finding the video footage and not being able to provide a legitimate reason, why the item was not scanned in or delivered, they had the video of it being dropped off at the desk It is all great, I know So wait, it gets better We did not declare a value So we only get , $100 Plus, they refund the label cost to Amazon, which Amazon, does not refund to us because again, we purchased the label from Amazon so like the item before, we lost money, the product, the shipping cost It is all great Right Happy Holidays!!!
So our account is suspended We have appealed both A-Z claims, which are denied We are out product cost and shipping, something like $600, well minus the $100 FedEx refunded Our account is suspended, because we did not fill the order But again It was the shipper, they have video and the testimony of the Manager who reviewed it We presented the claim and the Claim check to Amazon, still nothing We also were not able to get the other Customer to return the Non working item or Amazon did not require they do so, yet once again, we are talking $300 which again It cost $60 to ship Keep in mind, it is virtually impossible to damage this item. The electronics are in the wooden box, inside of a solid metal case, much like an ammo can, but much thicker. these are then covered with plastic The Customer made no mention of either, being damaged upon arrival, yet theTested and fully functional item"", now is not working? Strange right. Keep in mind, this is not some WalMart Junk, this is Bose It cost as much as a small compact car, to purchase. More than a Tata Car in India Yet, it is Not working, when it arrives to the Customer? Which I find difficult to believe
All in all, we are out $600, well $500 and our account has been suspended Amazon will not reverse the A-Z claims, yet we have FedEx attesting to 'Their having lost the item"" The other order, hell both claims, Amazon instantly issued refunds and processed A-Z claims against us Yet, once again, standard procedure is 72 hrs to respond We were given NO TIME Plus, they refuse to reverse the claims Yet once again We have testimony from FedEx, they have video footage, they issued a claim check StillNothing
Could Amazon seller support, be any worse?
We havent really ever had any issues, with our performance rating. We have sold items on Amazon for 5yrs now? We had an issue in the past, which was similar, due to a INTEL CPU, the Customer had the wrong chipset and was blaming us for it not working Then blamed us, for it being the wrong item, though they ordered it? So we processed the return, which went against our metrics Which ended up costing us, because there is a 1% returns allowance and we had not sold more than 20 items over the past couple months So our account was suspended
So some 4yrs later, we have this happen because of there being more than a 1% product defect rate, Amazon suspended our account What is that? I see items all of the time on Amazon Warehouse, those are all returns, all product defect rated issues Best Buy, Frys, WalMart, etc no one can keep a 1% defect rate in electronics, it is impossible User error, poor or cheap product quality ( which gets cheaper and cheaper, as time progresses), not to mention, Customers finding items cheaper elsewhere then opening false claims or worse, Customers who lie, because Amazon allows them to keep items, that are won, usign A-Z claims, because they can 'just not answer messages or return request""Plus, they get their money back Where there are countless online Police reports where Customers order things, and then, the items are fraudulently filed as damaged. ot working and these Customers, doing this over and over, to the tune of $100s k if not more than $1 mlllion. I saw someone had earned collected more than $1. 5 million in false claims and or items from Amazon, before getting caught Most everyone who sells, has had Customers do this, return items other than what was ordered, return their broken old goods, etc We had a Customer place an order and before we shipped the item, state that The item arrived a couple weeks ago , was working, now is not working Issue a refund. We had not even shipped the order, it was boxed, prepared for shipment, the following day I guess they got their fraudulent orders, mixed up? It happens all of the time It seems our Customers, the love to file claims on Bose products the most We have had 4 Bose Wave Radios that have had claims, keep in mind, these cost $500 each The items are always defective or something similar Yet you are talking about the most expensive items on the Market, Bose and Sonos Those are the most expensive products, in their Market share Yet, these items seem to frequently fail, from our testing floor to the time they arrive to the Customer That seems legit Meanwhile that Audiovox system that came from WalMart, it never arrives damaged So, I am guessing, Bose just makes cheap junk and people simply have not caught on that Bose items, are all junk and all fail Because they make, cheap or poorly made items Right? That is what our Customers say Wave Radios, Solo Units, Media Mate speakers, LSPS speaker systems, basically about ever Bose Product we sell, they all seem to fail, between the time the Customer receives the item and the time, it was shipped sometimes they fail, even before we ship them, evidently? I am still confused by this?
Yet again, here we are 1% defect rate It is not as if we are taking chances, selling junk We sell Bose, Klipsch, Boston, Infinity, Pioneer, Sony, I do not think we have any products that are not name brand? We had a TEA system, which is or was, the closest we had to discount electronics? Some Griffin sound systems, those seemed pretty cheap? But they were Apple Products, so those too, are all poorly made and have poor product quality Most of the time, it is the more expensive items, which fail Bose Wave Radios, we had a Bose SoundDock 10, that failed, after it was shipped Not sure about that one?But it is always, the expensive items that Customers open claims about While most of our Sony, Phillips, or similar type items, we never seem to have, any such issues. Only the MOST EXPENSIVE, items we have, which seem to always fail?
Anyways Any advice, how to resolve these problems? Get our Money back? Get our account, reactivated or unsuspended? There is literally, NOTHING MORE WE COULD HAVE DONE, to prevent or address, any of this We are not issuing instant refunds on items, we know worked , before they were shipped. We for certain, are not spending a fortune, shipping items back and forth, in the event a Customer found an item elsewhere, cheaper and opted to file false claims or when their item fails and wants to send us, their junk and replace it, with the item they purchased from us, at our expense
I mean, revenue stream is great, however we cannot sustain our business, losing $600 a month, not to mention the time and efforts, which we lost and or were not paid for, in trying to deal with this Even typing this, it was 20min which I will not get back Though need to vent Very irritating I need one of those boxes, with the sand and the rake
Anyways, thanks for your time and your advise",Account Health

Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team,
Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to appeal my seller accounts suspension for listing restricted products that are prohibited from sale on Amazon.
What went wrong / The Root Cause:
 In fact, I did unknowingly list a restricted product. I believe the error occurred in the information I provided when the listing was completed. Furthermore, Ive come to learn that Targus maybe a product that requires additional authorization to sell on your site
 Unfortunately, I am unable to specifically pinpoint where my error occurred. It was my intention to sell a stylus, which I do not believe is a restricted product, I can only surmise that the error occurred in the listing information that I supplied.
 I believe the error occurred in the listing. In the future to prevent this from happening, if theres anything that Im not absolutely certain about I will call you guys for a clear explanation.
 Please note, I was given 48 hours to remove the restricted products. However, at the time, I was given that
opportunity I never realized it. Upon my original account deactivation a few years back, I I was in the hospital and
unable to respond.
 At the end of last year, I decided to give selling another shot, I looked into my seller account, and I noticed the
newest performance notifications. After researching the Amazon Seller forums on restricted products, and how
to do plans of appeal, I prepared an appeal to state my case.
 Unfortunately, I no longer possess a picture of what I was trying to sell. Please keep in mind, this suspension.
ccurred about 4-5 years ago. I do apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
What I have done to fix the issue.
 I have carefully reviewed all of Amazons guidelines. Furthermore, to prevent any such violations from occurring in the future, Ive researched information regarding the sale of restricted products, the correct way to aadvertise my products.
 Ive educated myself about the products that are prohibited from sale and cant be listed. This includes your Restricted Products policy, including the Examples of Prohibited Listings section. Though its important to point out Ive never missed it a prohibited item, I have educated myself on what those items are to prevent any problems in the future.
 The final step Ive taken is to remove all of the listings that were in doubt, and being questioned. In the future, I will double check all of my listings to make sure that the products are described accurately, and are fully compliant with the rules that Amazon has set forth.
What I will do to prevent this from happening again:
 Ive educated myself about the products that are prohibited from sale, and cant be listed. This includes your Restricted Products policy, including the Examples of Prohibited Listings section. Though its important to point out Ive never missed it a prohibited item, I have educated myself on what those items are to prevent any problems in the future.
 Before listing any new items on Amazon, I will verify that they are permitted for sale, and compliant with Amazon policies and procedures.
 To help ensure that I do not violate any more policies, I will also research whether all of my products are accurately described, and correctly listed in the most informative way for any potential buyers.

This step is to simply list the item that I'm trying to sell.  I called reveal because here is where I reveal                 
everything about the product, such as photos, condition,  description etc.

Review
The final step is to review what I am trying to list for sale. At this point, I will review all of my research,
what I am trying to reveal, and Ill take this opportunity to give my listing one final look over.
Post 
Then, my product will be ready to be successfully listed!
 My weekly reviews, and new listing method should be my safeguard to fix my root cause I the future!

 These corrective  actions will ensure I can immediately take action, and proactively remain compliant with my     
   listings.  Any products that I am unable to verify with 100% certainty, will not be listed.
In conclusion , I believe that this plan provides that this issue has been rectified, and itll be prevented from occurring again. I look forward to having my selling privileges restored. I also look forward to hearing from you! Thanks again for your time!

Below is my draft for POA:
Dear Seller Performance Team,
This email is in response to the May 24, 2020 regarding buyer complaints for these ASINs:
B00IHSPAPW B016I9R4W8 B07QFCPKFF B00GOTB9HE B07KPV9PQM B07GL5PHTR B07PGHLMHT B07R7K9D48 B008VTLRBI B07FYS5Y3B B00T3N2MPQ B0034S8YP8
Root Causes:
Customer received damaged packaging or items due to inadequate protection to avoid damages in FBA warehouse or in transit.
Prior FBA returns that were marked as sellable although item was previously opened, prompting customer to think the item is used.
Defective item due to manufacturing defect (B07KPV9PQM, B07PGHLMHT)
Product photo has Hue/Lighting difference than actual product. (B0034S8YP8)
Actions Done:
We have look thru Account Health, Voice of the Customer, Customer Feedbacks, Buyer-Seller Messages, FBA Returns and Product Reviews to find the root causes.
We have reviewed all the policies linked in the email and understand them.
We have closed listings of the above ASINs until issues are resolved.
We have requested removal order of all remaining inventory of above ASINs in FBA warehouse.
We have inspected the inventory in our warehouse and check for any damages/defects.
We have only purchased directly from manufacturers or their authorized resellers and distributors.
Prevention:
We continue to sell only new, sealed merchandise purchased directly from manufacturers and authorized resellers and distributors.
We will inspect inventory thoroughly (identify defects/damages) before shipping it to FBA warehouse or directly to customers.
We will apply tamper proof seal on collector items before sending to FBA warehouse to avoid returned items being marked as sellable.
We will bubblewrap / polybag items and apply FNSKU label so that:
item will be adequately protected from warehouse or carrier damages.
reduce/eliminate the chance of previously returned and opened item be marked as sellable incorrectly.
We will monitor Voice of the Customer, Customer Feedbacks, FBA Returns and Product Reviews daily to identify any problem and to minimize repeat problem of the items.
We will continue to review Product Detail Page before listing, specifically to request image update when there is discrepancies on lighting/hue of the actual product; and to ensure Product Detail Page has correct information.",Account Health
1166,Invoice Requirements (multi-page invoice & 365 days),"I have 2 questions regarding the invoice requirements:
1. Multi-page invoice - should I submit just the invoice page which contains the ASIN in question OR the entire multi-page invoice?
2. 365 days - I have an invoice from >365 days. It is a slow-selling ASIN. What kind of language should I include in my appeal to address this issue?
After extensive research on these forums, I have only read conflicting information. Therefore, I would appreciate if you share your actual experiences with Seller Performance regarding these 2 issues.",Account Health
1167,Account Performance Update,"Hi, With The June 1 date looming, I have about 35 orders from last week we have yet to ship due to issue with a label that apply s to the product. We should have them all shipped by next Wednesday. Would you go and cancel the order s before the June deadline on account suspensions, or would you just ship as soon as able? I dont know if the June 1 date is for new orders from that date forward, or any late tracking , deliverys ect, start from that date on older orders. Any insight is appreciated.
thanks",Account Health
1168,Negative feedback removal,"One of our customers left a negative feedback that the book is listed as a hardcover version, but the copy that she received was a paperback version.
Its hard to blame the customer because it is actually a paperback verson, but Amazon misled the customer by listing it as hardcover. Many sellers are selling this products, including Amazon itself.
This is apparently a mistake by Amazon, so we tried to contact Amazon to remove the feedback. Amazon revised the binding, but denied our request twice.
What can we do now???",Account Health
1169,"Selling Account Deactivated- Restricted Products - Holding over $50,000","2 weeks ago, our Amazon account was suspended due to listing a restricted product. As the title states, they are holding over $50,000.
I am a small business, and have been keeping our employees employed and paid during this global pandemic until Amazon put a stop to that.
We take full responsibility for our mistake, and wrote a very clear and concise plan of action detailing exactly what went wrong, what we did to fix it, and what we are doing to prevent that from happening again. I assure you, our plan of action was rejected and we received the following message:
"" After reviewing your account and the information you provided, we have decided that your selling account will remain deactivated. Why is this happening? We reached this decision because you listed items that are not permitted for sale on Amazon.com 68. Items sold on Amazon.com 68 must adhere to all applicable laws and Amazons policies. What happens now? If you have funds in your account, any amounts paid for A-to-Z claims or chargebacks on your orders will be deducted from those funds. Any remaining funds may be permanently held as a result of these violations. You can see your balance and settlement information in the Payments section of Seller Central. If you have questions about those, please send an email to payments-funds@amazon.com.""
We were not invited to resubmit a new plan or that there would even be a follow up. We are honest sellers with a decade-long relationship with Amazon and have made an honest mistakewe are paying for it greatly.
I understand Amazon claimed that they are willing to work with sellers during this ongoing global pandemic, but they are making it difficult for me to keep employees paid during this time.
Is there any recourse I can take whatsoever?",Account Health
1170,I need reliable business advice fast,"Im in a bit of a pickle and am desperate for some perspective on my current situation. Ill try to convey my problem as concisely as possible but its pretty complex.
Problem #1. I cannot take credit cards.
I am an entrepreneur with several online businesses, but the only one that made me over $1 million is my supplement brand. Selling supplements is great because they are easy to ship and after making an initial purchase your customers consume them, then come back for more. The flip side is that the supplement industry is famously known by banks as a high-risk industry with a high chargeback rate. Well, last year my merchant account was terminated and I was placed on the MATCH list due to excessive chargebacks. Authorize, Square, Paypal, even Venmo eventually shut down my payment processor because (1) Im on the MATCH list, and (2) Once they find out youre selling supplements, even if its just vitamins, its game over. My websites are still running with Zelle, Bank Transfer, and Crypto as the only payment methods, but no one uses these. I basically went from $300,000 a month to less than $300 in sales practically overnight. So my first probable solution is to find a new way to take credit cards online. I tried to have friends and family open up a merchant account in their for my business, but the 5 people I approached about this either A.) Have an ethical problem with doing this, B.) Said the wrong things to the bank and they refused to open an account (ie: they are idiots) or C.) They are asking for a ridiculous percentage of the money that would come in, to the point where I would not make a profit.
Problem #2. I have nowhere to house my inventory.
The obvious solution (for me) after learning that I wouldnt be able to accept credit cards any longer was to simply start selling on 3rd party markets. Ive been building up my Amazon account over the past few years, which is terribly difficult to do with private label items vs major brands. Things seemed to be going great with both sales and reviews gradually growing, so I decided to send all of my inventory from a local warehouse to FBA because it was much more affordable. Then about 3 months ago I get a message telling me that my Amazon account has been deactivated. The reason? Multiple Accounts. From what I understand, Amazon thought that my girlfriends seller account was my own because we share the same IP address and physical address despite her account being a completely different entity and EIN. (her account was also shut down) Yes, this is the whole story and yes, I realize it makes no sense. I spent the last 3 months relentlessly fighting this decision, trust me, I did everything I could think of to make them realize this was a mistake but their ultimate decision was this: You have until June 8, 2020 to remove all of your inventory from FBA or it will be disposed of. We may not reply to further appeals.
So now I have about a week to find a place to house several pallets of product that retails for over $100,000. Ive contacted several liquidaters but because all of my inventory is private label (my own brand) no one wants it. Normally, I would just move them to a private warehouse, but because of everything that has been going on I have little to no working capital left. I can afford to move my products once, hopefully to a place where I can continue to sell them, but the reality is that I dont have a reliable way of selling my products. My inventory is basically my entire life savings at this point, so I need to act fast to save my investment.
This is the whole story and subject of my torment. Are there any options here that Im not seeing? Honestly, Im freaking out because I dont know what to do.",Account Health
1171,Appeal pending for >2 months now - other options?,"Account was deactivated due to one or more duplicate accounts. The duplicate account theyre referring to is actually my girlfriends business (also currently suspended for the same reason) which is a different entity, different EIN, sells different products, but we have the same physical address, IP address, and I think I may have used her credit card / bank account for a short period on my account in the past, though all of the billing info currently reflects my own name and info.
This was a simple mistake, probably an automated action, where both of our accounts were flagged at the same time because they were mistaken for the same business. Ive been trying to communicate that to Amazon / seller performance for 2 months now but everytime I talk to someone I am told my appeal is STILL under review and all I can do is wait it out.
Naturally, they wont release my funds and today my bank account hit zero. I am desperately trying to find ways to supplement my income, but after 2 moths of awaiting my appeal to be processed, I am losing hope that my account will ever be reactivated - and all of this from a very simple misunderstanding!
Guys, Im desperate. Do I have any more moves here, or should I just focus all of my energy entirely in making money elsewhere and cut my losses? Anyone else experiencing EXTREMELY long wait times for appeal review? Thanks.",Account Health
1172,Deactivated account,How do I get my money back from amazon I created a seller account but I was accepted into the seller account in 24hrs then one hour later it said that my account was deactivated because I was related to another amazon seller account. I have never ever signed up to sell on amazon before In my life I dont get how I am related to someone or anything of that sort can I just close the account and get my initial deposit back?,Account Health
1173,Hard delete,"Is it possible to permanently hard delete our account and open a new account with the same information? there is someone who says that it is possible, and who gives support and is very confident. has repeatedly provided support on this issue and has never been related associated with it. What are you saying?",Account Health
1174,Related account suspension after opening other Regional accounts,"Hello
This just happened to me yesterday and I just opened the account for some reason it prompted me to got to the Amazon Japan, Amazaon UK, and Amazon Europe, and answer seller questions and my contact information; I could not close the page out or exit it made me fill all the information in about 30 minutes I got emails from Japan, UK, and Europe stating I owed money in account and that my fees havent been paid is this a virus or malware? It seem like the whole intent was to close my account, and in about 30 minutes later my United States account was suspended. I just dont get it Im a new user I only have a customer Amazon account and just opened the seller account on 2/18/2020. I purchased a single item, I havent added a single item, I havent even confirmed a shipment.

1176,USPS delays on SFP shipments,"Amazon Buy Shipping API let me generate Valid shipping labels for a lot of orders last week via USPS Priority Mail.

When we realized what was happening with USPS we dropped them as a shipper and are solely UPS (wished I did this a week ago) but here we are.

What caused customers to complain about the condition of your items?
The root cause of the issue is that we failed to adequately package our item to prevent it from being damaged during shipment. We need to upgrade our packing material and inspection process to ensure a safe delivery.
Upon reviewing my listings and sales history its my belief that the complaint occurred due to insufficient packing material. The bubble mailer we used was not protective enough for this item to arrive safely.
An example of this is order Id 113-9012181-7489819. The customer messaged us to let us know the item arrived in open condition, even though the item was listed as new. This is a violation of condition guidelines.

What have you done to resolve the issue(s) that caused the customer complaints about the condition of your items?
I have reached out to the customers and resolved the issues with refunds, replacements, and returns. I accept full responsibility for this issue.
I have immediately switched our packaging material to sturdier cardboard boxes. These boxes will replace bubble mailers.
I have audited our new and used inventory to ensure that there is no co-mingling of new and used. I have verified that our new and used inventory are in separate sections of the warehouse.
I have purchased and installed additional lighting in our shipping areas to make spotting flaws and issues more probable before items are dispatched.
I have read and reviewed the help articles and I fully understand the various listing conditions and their guidelines.
I have verified that my item(s) conditions are listed accurately and fixed any that werent correct.
I verified and reviewed the product detail pages for accuracy and uploaded updates as needed.
I have added additional steps to my verification process to ensure my products are authentic and of the quality advertised. This includes inspecting all 6 sides of every item shipped.
I have fully reviewed, read, & understand the following articles regarding Amazon policies and best practices:

What actions will you be taking to prevent future complaints about the condition of your items?
Sourcing: Are you sourcing the product from a trusted supplier that sells items in condition?
I will continue to source new items directly from the manufacturer or an official wholesale distributor only.
Listing: Is the product accurately described on Amazon? Have you ensured that there is no ambiguity and the customer is well informed?
I am reviewing my listings and have updated any that were ambiguous and needing more information. I am spending more time reviewing listing descriptions before adding my products. I will continue to diligently review and monitor my current & future listings and update them as needed.
Packaging: Is the product in its original manufacturer packaging as listed on Amazon?
I am verifying that new items I sell are in the original manufacturer packing as listed on Amazon. This will be facilitated by using only original manufacturers case packaging for warehouse storage.
Shipping: Have you taken all appropriate steps and quality checks to ensure that the product is stored, packed, and shipped appropriately, and will not be damaged when shipped?
I have reviewed the forums and help articles for tips and info on better shipping practices. Ill be shopping and sourcing additional shipping materials that are better suited to shipping my items safely. This includes an increase in the quality and quantity of all shipping supplies; tape, boxes, bubble wrap, etc. Also items will be inspected more carefully for defects before shipping is complete. This will be enhanced with new lighting Ive installed.
I will continue to monitor our account health and the voice of our customers in an effort to stay ahead of any issues before they become a bigger problem.
I will be more active on the Amazon Seller Central forums, using the knowledge and wisdom of successful sellers and the moderators to improve my business practices.
I will always provide prompt refunds and rush reshipping of any item that needs to be replaced.",Account Health
1181,Brand admitted to making a fake counterfeit claim in email. What do to?,"We began selling some watches from a brand about a month ago. We purchased directly from the brand, and the brand gave us written Amazon authorization to sell their products.
Right after we began selling the watches, the brand owner (the same people we bought the product from and have an invoice from) made a counterfeit claim to Amazon about our products.
We immediately contacted the brand and they admitted in email (we have the emails still) that they made a fake counterfeit claim to get us kicked off their listings because they have since decided that they want to be the only seller of their brand. This is even though our Amazon authorization is dated as good until August 2020. My head is spinning at how illegal this is and have a couple questions for you guys
This company is based in China but are selling here on Amazon US and therefore have a presence here in the states. Our attorney informed us that we can definitely litigate against this company ( and should be 100% successful ) However is there a point if its going to be almost impossible to collect because they are in China?

1183,Please need assistance with appeal for suspended account,"Hello,
I understand that AMAZON takes these complaints if intellectual property and infringement claim very seriously and I would like to provide you with my plan of action to explain what I will do to prevent similar complaints in the near future. There were a few reasons why these mistakes were made. During the epidemic my sales manager was tested positive for COVID-19 so we had to clear the warehouse and our offices and at the same time we were trying to keep our business going as well, we started to work from home and I was not able to monitor my AMAZON account closely because I was in quarantine and had limited access to my documents and could not leave the house due to the virus issue and my health problems also hindered me from working.
Root Cause:
 This was vendor we worked with in past, sold his items which we received violation for. Documents are attached for proof or purchases.
 3 items in question were missing vendors UPC code and were overlooked when we were in process of deleting this companys item from our inventory due to UPC codes and SKUs error. When we were buying items from we were given permission to use the trademark and logo we had permission but when we cut our ties our permission was voided.
 We stopped working with this vendor due to price increase, quality control issues.
 We removed the entire inventory which we use to purchase from this vendor
 3 Listings were overlooked; due to UPC codes were not accurate on our part.
 Our listing process is very strict, we ONLY do individual listings. NO excel auto upload, for some reason this vendor we purchased a UPC list, this was before we stopped the auto uploads
 Our seller name is different from our buying name, which the vendor was not aware of this information.
 Take full responsibility for these issues, and we acknowledge the fact that these are serious and we will address them immediately.
Action taken to resolve the issue:
 Contacted vendor 2 times via email, and requesting them to retract the complaint, but no response to both emails.
 I also have contacted the company and made them aware that company A is a sister company to company b.
 Notified ALL of my vendors that we are selling on AMAZON.com
 The entire inventory is being reviewed by me and my 2 sales/purchasing managers and making sure items are in line with all vendors we work with.
 After the review we immediately removed any and all listings belonging to the company, and any other listings which could be in question.
 Reviewed all rules and regulations of Infringement Products Policy and Intellectual rights with my sales and purchasing team. Trademark rules and regulations also have been reviewed.
 All Amazon polices were printed and reviewed by the personnel very carefully along side of our legal team to get a better understanding of wording.
Actions take to prevent any issues in future:
 Before making any listing on AMAZON I will check and verify that products and listings dont violate anyones intellectual property, trademark, copyright, or patent by assigning a person who will check and confirm that these items are in clear and are indeed being purchased from the correct source. example website www.trademarkia.com 1
 Review Amazon guideline on regular basis on weekly basis to make sure we are up to date and missing any important information pertaining to Infringements or intellectual property rights.
 I will be contacting my ALL suppliers and updating them with our seller name so there will be no confusion
 I will also alert them that we are selling on AMAZON and if any issue or concerns so they can address them to us directly.
 Review all active items on a regular basis to make sure we are still purchasing them from correct vendors and make sure we do not receive any future complaints
 All inventories will be carefully reviewed prior to creating any listings in the future.
 Effective immediately we will train our employees all of the AMAZON policies to make sure we do not have this issue again.

I am selling Private Label (under my own brand name - I have a Trademark for my brand). However, on the packing there is a text (Example: BLAH BLAH BLAH). I ordered from my manufacturer since Oct, 2019 (when the Trademark above not available).
Cause of Covid-19 so the delay of producing, shipment so it arrived on Amazon Warehouse on April 2020. However, after available on Amazon. The owner of trademark above reported and my ASIN blocked.
About the text (example: BLAH BLAH BLAH). My manufacturer designed it since 2011 and they sold for Bed Bath and Bayond for a long time (They sent me invoice, payment documents, Original design since 2011). But the owner of Trademark 59***** registered the trademark and available on November 2019.

Complaint Type ASIN Title Additional Information
Used Item Sold as New xxx
We are the Amazon Brand Registry Owner of ASIN xxx. XXX website is www.xxx.com. Here is the link to the product detail page on our website https://www.xxx.com/products/xxx
What was the root cause that led to the issue?
Damaged Retail Package on Arrival
a. Too small of box used
b. No packing material
c. Product packaged in a thinner clamshell
Item Defective Complaint that mentions that the U-mounts (u-bolts) scratched bike when installed.
What actions will you take to resolve the issue?
During the pandemic shutdown our custom clamshell order was delayed. We substituted a stock clamshell that was the same size but not as thick. We have since received our custom clamshells and all our inventory of ASIN xxx is now packaged in our heavy-duty clamshells.
We put an additional warning on all of our existing packaging (278 insert cards). We added a sticker on all of our packaging with instructions that state Note: If you are concerned about the finish on your bike frame or ATV railing, wrap bar first with black electrical tape where the u-bolt will come into contact with it.
A full refund was issued immediately to the customer who stated that the u-bolt scratched their bike and was told she did NOT need to return the item. Full refunds were also given to all customers who stated the item was defective or doesnt work and were told they did NOT need to return the items.
What steps will you take to prevent future issues?
Damaged Retail Package on Arrival
a. We will no longer use the USPS small flat rate boxes because there may not be sufficient room for the product to move if tossed or dropped by the carrier.
b. We will now use Kraft packing paper, packaging peanuts and/or packing bubble wrap to fill in the empty spaces in our boxes and padded envelopes. This will provide more cushioning and protection.
c. We will use our custom clamshells that are thicker. We will no longer substitute stock clamshells for our custom clamshells.
U-mounts (u-bolts) scratched bike when installed
a. Our package currently has a warning that Purchaser uses this product at own risk and instructions not to overtighten u-bolts. We have strengthened that warning. And we have ordered new packaging with the following printed in red on the instructions; Note: If you are concerned about the finish on your bike frame or ATV railing, wrap bar first with black electrical tape where the u-bolt will come into contact with it. This updated packaging is being printed and will be available in a couple weeks. We will switch out the insert cards with the printed sticker warning for these new cards.
Here are the invoices from our suppliers for the components used in ASIN xxx. Components are sourced from various factories and inspected and packaged at our location in the United States.
There are two invoices for hardware used in this product. One invoice is 3/26/19 and the other is 3/31/20. We typically order hardware in the spring. Spring is when our sales our slow and we package our hardware packets that go into each of our products for the upcoming year.
One of the invoices has the address of our secondary location where we receive our LTL shipments.
And one has our location along with our storage unit location where we store some of our components.
When we place new orders for components, we have our factories submit pre-run samples. Our engineer tests these to make sure that our tolerances are met. When we receive a shipment, we randomly spot test a percentage of our components (predetermined by each individual component) to make sure that the factories continue to meet our strict tolerances.
We individually package each of our products this allows us to inspect all individual component for flaws and ensure that each component meets our high standards.
When orders are fulfilled for Amazon, the item is taken from our case pack boxes and examined to make sure that the package is in pristine condition before being packed and shipped to the customers.
We provide a limited lifetime warranty against defects of manufacture on all our products.",Account Health

This could make the customer think that the item they received was used. The scratches for this item appear exactly between the (removed). This area is called the (removed) and will have varying degree of scratches on every single one that is sold. The statement we sent in previously is a direct quote from the manufacturer, it explains that their products will have a scratched (removed) due to manufacturing. Here is the statement, which is again direct from the manufacturer with whom we have a very close relationship.
I would like to comment that this appears to part of our normal manufacturing process. The area on the (removed) cannot be fully painted. High injection pressures are required to inject the (removed) material and there needs to be a tight seal against (removed) l, which leaves the (removed) with scratches, and where the powder coat simply cannot withstand that; thus leaving an unpainted (removed). The bases are made of a (removed, type of material discussed here) and you should encounter no issues with weather affecting the product. (Removed) come with a Lifetime Warranty so if you ever have an issue with the product, other than cosmetic, please reach out to us and we will replace the damaged part.

For this customer, and any other customers that have this issue or any other issue with the items we sell, we are more than happy to accept a return and issue a full refund. We do want to make sure each and every customer is taken care of and gets the service Amazon customers deserve and expect. While we cannot fix the item itself, we can make sure the customer doesnt have to pay anything and can make sure they are made whole. As soon as this customer sends the item back to us we will be sure to promptly issue the customer a full refund.
We will start to inspect our own inventory for any items during the shipping process and FBA preparation process that might have more egregious scratch marks on them, and make sure that any we find will NOT be sold and will be disposed or returned to the supplier. A very small percentage of the time, we have seen some (removed) that have worse scratches than others, so we will start to make sure that these particular products are not sold.
We will request an inventory bin check at FBA to confirm all of our products meet new condition.

We will work directly with the brand owner and manufacturer to make sure we update the product page to inform customers of this particular issue. We will try to edit the description of the product ourselves to put more detail on the page that explains that the scratch marks on the (removed) are completely normal and part of the manufacturing process, so once they receive it, as long as they read the product description they will understand and should not return the item nor be dissatisfied. Unfortunately we probably cant edit the description ourselves, as every time we try to do this on a ASIN we didnt create, the update doesnt ever take hold and seller support tells us it has to be the brand owner that updates it. We will do everything in our power to make sure that the page gets updated so customers are aware before they complete their purchase.
The reviews on this item are almost all 5 stars, it is clear that most customers are not upset at the scratch marks that come on the (removed) but we do want to make sure each and every customer is taken care of, so this is why we want to update the product page. Knowing before they purchase should prevent all future complaints (but again, the customers have to read the product page).
We will also make sure that any item that gets returned to us is NOT resold. We do not resell returns, we in fact either return them to our suppliers or we simply dispose of them into the trash. Each one of our employees that work in the return department are well trained in this and we do have set procedures to make sure items that are returned do not get put back in our sellable inventory. Even if the item looks like it was not opened, we do not resell them because we do not want to risk a customer thinking they may have received a used item. We completely understand how important this is.
When we get inventory in we will inspect and make sure they all pass our quality control. As we explained above, a very small percentage of these products will have worse scratching so we will make sure these ones are put to the side and disposed of since they do not pass our quality control. We do count each and every product we receive to make sure our suppliers send us the right amount, so when we are counting we will implement a new process to check the products for any out of the ordinary damage or condition that would prevent it from looking 100% brand new.
We will continue to stress hard with the manufacturer that they need to work on a solution to prevent these types of complaints. We wish the item didnt have these particular scratch marks on them so we will see if theres a way we can get the manufacturer to further implement another step in their manufacturing process to make the (removed) of the (removed) appear to be more aesthetically pleasing.
However, as stated above, as long as we update the product page and customers are aware this is not a defect, it does not mean the item is used in anyway, it simply is just part of manufacturing there should not be any future complaints.
To an effort to provide Seller Performance with more detail, we are uploading the invoice copy that we did before and other invoices showing a purchase of (removed) units. We are also uploading some images that show the products we carry and how they are brand new in packaging but all still have the same markings.
We are one of the worlds largest dealers for this particular brand and product line, we have been buying from the same distributor, (removed), for over 5 years. They are one of the most trusted distributors for this brand and if you contact (removed) or the brand/manufacturer you can verify this information. Here is the contact page for the manufacturer: (removed).
We hope this information is sufficient to reinstate our listing. Thank you.

Please help me out with this POA. I really am at a loss as to how I can provide GREATER detail. Ive gone more detailed than I would ever thought would be required here. I sent three invoices and images of a product from my inventory showing the scratches that are a result of manufacturing.
Thanks for any help.",Account Health

1198,Why Someone can report trademark infringement with only one Serial Number but NO REGISTRATION NUMBER ? Need detailed explanation and just solution,"Hello Amazon Team,
We write this post because we were involved into trademark infringement on the product detail page associated with our listings and our listing is removed by Amazon. We must reiterate over and over again that we obey any intellectual property laws and any policies issued by Amazon, but do need more explanation to all of our doubts. What happened is this:
We received a email from Amazon that there was a report of trademark infringement on the product detail page associated with one or more of our listings. In the email, the so-called Trademark Amazon offered is only a Serial Number. For this point, weve confirmed it on the official site of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Amazon can also investigate it.
On the official site of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, anyone can see it very clearly that a real trademark should include at least the information like the Published for Opposition, Registration Number and Registration Date. Without all the information, it means the so-called rights owner has not got the APPROVAL from U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. As we understand it, no one has the right to report others with only a Serial Number that his intellectual property is infringed, and Amazon can not say that he is the rights owner. As the victim we cant accept such kind of unjust accusations.
We dont think there is any misunderstanding that when someone reports others infringe his trademark right, the precondition is that he is the rights owner of the trademark. Before he asks us to provide proof of product authenticity, he should provide the proof that he is the real rights owner. Dont you think so?
Weve sent several emails to Amazon to reflect all these problems but never got a detailed explanation and only asked us to remove the infringement content. Today a Amazon customer service told us that the Seller Performance Team who takes charge of Intellectual Property wont explain any details about the reason why they accept or dont accept the report of trademark infringement and wont provide any proof to convince the person being reported when he has any doubt.
However, we do have some doubts and wont give up appealing until we get the detailed explanation and convincing evidence which proves that we do infringe others trademark rights.
Weve also read the Intellectual Property Policy for Sellers carefully and find this statement  In some cases, a person or company might have trademark rights based on only the use of a mark in commerce, even though the mark was never registered with a country-specific trademark office. Those rights are known as common law trademark rights and can be more limited..
If our case belongs to this situation, please help to explain what some cases refer to so that we know it very well. Thanks.
If it does not belong to this situation, then anyone can spend only US$800 to submit the application for the trademark, get a Serial Number, NO APPROVAL from U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and then report any sellers on Amazon to remove others listing. How low the cost of unfair competition it is! How unfair it is to all other sellers like us!
We seriously doubt that there is black-box operation in the case of report of trademark infringement. If not, why Amazon never gives a reasonable explanation for our doubts? As a dedicated and honest seller, we feel very sad and disappointed that we were forced to accept such kind of unjust accusations and no one accept our appeals.
We do need your help to investigate the case. Sincerely hope Amazon could take it seriously because this is a kind of abuse of reporting rights. It causes very bad effect on innocent sellers and development of Amazon itself.
Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

I received the following message from Amazon Seller Performance flagging a Variation that I have used for over a year now:
Hello, The listing(s) at the bottom of this message has been edited due to a violation of Amazons ASIN Creation policy.
Why did this happen?
Sellers on Amazon.com 1 are not allowed to add invalid variations. This includes, but is not limited to:
 Adding children products that are not actual variations of the parent product (e.g., newer version or model of product, different branded products, etc.).
 Adding duplicate child variations that are not substantially different than other variations within the family (e.g., Red 1, Red 2, Red 3, etc.).
Were here to help.
If you need help better understanding what is causing this, please reference our ASIN Creation Policy in Seller Central Help and review the Variation Policy section (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G201844590 3).
Have your listings been corrected in error?
If you believe there has been an error, please submit an explanation. Your explanation should include the following information:
 How your account has not violated our ASIN Creation policy.
 Evidence or examples that demonstrate that your account has complied with the ASIN Creation policy.
How do I send the required information?

My question: So I have re-read the sections on ASIN creation and variations and I believe that this product set is an approved variation.
Any clue why this variation set got flagged? They are all the exact same product but vary based on Size (5 pieces, 75 pieces, 150 pieces, and 300 pieces  all done by the manufacturer)
While this variation set has been removed, a similar variation set can be found using ASIN: B07PGMDGRM
Is this method of using Set 1, Set 2, Set 3 not an approved method for Size variations?
A little background on this variation set: up until about 3 months ago, I was using 75 pieces, 150 pieces, and 300 pieces as the size variation. Woke up one morning and it was Set 1, Set 2, Set 3 which I thought was weird. After talking with Amazon customer service, they informed me that they were standardizing variations and that they made that change to the Size variation for me. There are no other sellers on these products, so Im curious if the Size variation method is not approved and if I should remove all of my current variations that are set up as such.
Thanks in advance,",Account Health

We received an performance notifications on May 13, 2020 , which said that our item was Violation of product policy compliance,Attachment 3 contains detailed sales information for all SKUs.
We are deeply sorry and remorse when receiving the Violation of product policy compliance. We immediately check the listing and the product.
The reasons for not being approved are:
We did nt read Amazon s policies carefully and did nt know what information to submit
In order to allow customers to COVID-19 Supplies supplies faster, we did not submit invoices and related certificates for our products.
To this end, we have done the following operations:
Remove all of our products and carefully check to ensure that our products are in compliance with Amazon policy requirements,
Study Amazons relevant policies carefully to ensure that this will not happen again,
Provide the suppliers detailed information, product qualification certificate and invoice, so that the Amazon team can more easily check our products.
we cooperated with our supplier to offer high-quality product to Amazon customers. Here is our suppliers info:
Company Name:
Address: ****
Contact person************
Phone Number: ****************
And weve provided more information Proof of product authenticity as follow:
File 1:FDA registration certificate
File 2:authorization certificate
File 3: SKU Details
File 4: Copies of invoices
File 5:Result of State Taxation Administration
For the product(5PCS Folding N-95 Particulate Respirator Dust Masks, 4-Layer Disposable N95 Particulate Respirator Protection Maask Filters 95%, Non-Woven Respirator Maasks), it is very popular and has a large demand for people. This product was very popular during the epidemic, and we also hope to help customers to pass this difficult stage more safely and healthily. Before we put our products on Amazon, we have made sufficient preparations to avoid this situation again. We will require all personnel of the company to carefully study Amazons relevant policies, conduct examinations and inspections, and communicate better with suppliers to make our products better in quality and more in line with customer requirements.
From above, we do not infringe the complainants Intellectual property. And to avoide make this miatakes again, we take actions as bellow:
1.Check all the inventory and listings seriously in case of the problem which doesnt meet Amazons requirements. We have fixed the problem checked out, ensure all our listings are authentic and avoid all non-compliance .
2.We will seriously learn the Amazons policies and rules again and obey them in case of making mistakes again. We will build up a team to double check the listings and products, ensure we wont infringe others.
3.We have checked all the products we sold, all the complains and product problems, and handle it in a correct way in 12 hours, to safeguard customers rights.
4.For the product sale in the future, if any uncertain info, we will contact Amazon immediately rather than sale it blindly.
With the above improvements, we have full confidence that we are able to do it better and want to stay with Amazons business and grow together. We sincerely hope that you can give us an opportunity to improve and we will use our actual action to offer better shopping to our customers as well as in the company with the Amazon policies. We company has the confidence to do it better!
We appreciate your time and your attention on this issue. If any further information needed please inform us and we will try our best to cooperate with your team.",Account Health
1212,Account Suspension - Inauthentic Product Claims for Products We Have Not Sold,"Hello All,
Im now going on two months of trying to get my seller account reinstated after receiving an inauthentic product suspension for three of my listings. These products were not sold, therefore it is impossible for there to have been any negative feedback or any indication to our knowledge that these products were inauthentic. We recognize our suppliers as reputable and believe that the information we can and have already provided to Amazon should exonerate us from these claims, but Amazon has only responded with appeal rejections. Amazon has been vague in their responses and it is unclear what I am to do to prove that these products are authentic. We immediately inactivated all of our product listings, including the ones suspected of being inauthentic. We collected invoices for the products and information on the companies we purchase our products from. Ive gone as far as to hire an (expensive) appeal service that a personal friend has used for a very similar issue, even selling the same types of products, with success, and there is still no sun on the horizon. I havent spoken with anyone at Amazon other than what seems to be an automatically generated rejection message. If the products infringe on intellectual property rights (which we do not believe they do), we have stated and detailed in our POA how we will diligently ensure that all products we list in the future are beyond reasonable doubt to abide by IP law in the future. However, with several other products we are interested in listing and have come to list, there is an application process in place to ensure that an individual seller is authorized to sell certain brands. If we werent authorized to sell a certain product or brand, we believed those products would have that process in place, as other products have. It genuinely feels like there is no interest on Amazons end to help resolve the issue and like we have just been arbitrarily removed from the platform. Being a new, young entrepreneur, I feel like Im already at the end of my rope in ways beyond just this suspension.
Below Ive copied and pasted the original suspension letter. If there is anything at all that anyone can offer as a solution or piece of advice, I would tremendously appreciate it.
Start of the letter:

1214,Reasons for Blocked listings,"Hi Seller Forum,
One of my top products has been blocked. The product shows an Inactive Blocked status with a red icon on the Inventory screen. And when I click on the Inactive Blocked status link I get the message below.
You need approval to list this product.
Refurbished condition:
You cannot list the product in this condition.
[Request approval]
However we are not accepting applications to sell:
Other Home and Garden (including Pet Supplies) category in Refurbished condition(s)
We only sell new products, and I have submitted several POAs to address this issue, but they have been declined.
The following link on seller central states that if the Blocked Listing status has a red icon, it cannot be relisted. https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html?itemID=GGKKCTPTVTF95E5
The Reasons for Blocked listings
Amazon can block listings for a number of reasons, including when products are [prohibited] [restricted] or [recalled]
Blocked listings appear on the Manage Inventory page with a status of Inactive (Blocked). Next to the status will be one of the following indicators:
Red icon: Product cannot be relisted
Yellow icon: Product can be relisted
Im trying to determine next steps. Is there anyway, at this point, to get this product relisted?
Do I try to submit another appeal?
Should I remove all the inventory and resubmit an appeal?
Any help you can provide would be appreciated.",Account Health

1217,New Seller - Suspected Intellectual Property Violations,"Im a new seller with an account deactivation. Would anyone be able to suggest point(s) I should include when I resubmit an appeal? Your time is greatly appreciated!
Background: I had 10 ASINs with Suspected Intellectual Property Violations.
These ASINs were non-branded generic items.
-Epi Leather (a type of leather product, not trademarked)
-Moon Backpack( shape of a backpack, not trademarked)
-Pouchette Bag(description of a bag, not trademarked)
-Leather Brown Shoulder Crossbody Bag (categories of bags)
Some of the ASINs were in an inactive status (I was treating like draft listings) or in a suppressed status (background pics did not have white backgrounds).
Rejected Appeal-
The account deactivation was caused by my lack of complete understanding of the rules and policies applying to the use of copyrights and trademarks. In addition, I also lacked complete understanding of how to appropriately create, describe, and manage my product listings.
I have reviewed Amazons Intellectual Property Policy and the Intellectual Property Policy for Sellers-FAQ about Trademarks. The example of the Pinzon Flannel Sheet Set product detail page clearly demonstrates the manner in which I was causing customer confusion to the source, endorsement, or affiliation of the products I had listed.
I have also reviewed information on the Sellers Forum pertaining to intellectual property violations. I understand violations can occur from pictures, titles, product detail information, and also words utilized in keyword searches. As these are all ways, customers can be confused to the source, endorsement, or affiliation of products, and potentially infringe on the property rights of the rights owner(s).
I have reviewed information on the Sellers forum in order to learn how to effectively manage listings marked as potential trademark violations.
-If I never intend to sell the product, the listing will be deleted. I will not leave the listing in an inactive or suppressed status. (Even though I never intended to relist these products, Amazon could not have known this information; as the listings could simply be edited in a future time.)
-If my intention is to sell a product marked as potention trademark violation, I will contact Amazon to rectify the element causing the violation. I will not delete the listing, and create another listing that unknowingly could potentially still have a violation. If a resolution can not be found, I will not sell the product.
To prevent any confusion for customers on Amazon, and to prevent infringing on the property rights of others, I will only use descriptions of my actual products in listing information. (For example, I will only refer to a beverage as a carbonated soda, not as a Coke.)
I will perform timely reviews of any received Performance Notifications. Understanding these violations are maintained on my performance record for 180 days before they are removed.
I will continue to educate myself in order to maintain the high standards and expectations set forth as an Amazon seller.
-I have the United States Patent & Trademark Office search site saved to my Favorites for a resource reference.
-I will refer to the document Intellectual Property Policy for Sellers-FAQ about Trademarks in order to obtain ongoing education on these issues.
-I will utilize the Sellers Forum to thoughtfully consider and study ways trademarks and copyrights can be unintentionally utilized to prevent any further customer confusion and/or Amazon violations. (For example, referring to a red-green stripe could potentially infringe on the rights of Gucci.)
I will carefully consider the use of words in titles, product detail information, key word search information, and my choice of pictures to ensure I am not confusing customers on Amazon to the source, endorsement, or affiliation of products, and potentially infringe on the property rights of the rights owners.
I value my ability to sell on Amazon and will work to meet the high expectations set forth.",Account Health

1226,Help with POA Sold and Shipped New Item Customer Complained,"Hello All,
We sold an item that was brand new, but the customer complained it was a used product (we dont sell used products at all). This product comes in a colorful manufacturer box that is a heavy duty box so we did not see the need to repack it. The customer looked at the box condition and reported as a used item. I followed up with the customer, who decided to compare the same product to one in the nearby retail store.
Here is the actual feedback posted by the customer.

A plan of action that explains:
The issue(s) that led to the complaints about the product condition or description of your items.
This ASIN B0195BUH84 was sold as a brand new, and we shipped a brand new unit to the customer. This product comes in a colorful original manufacturer packaging, a typical DEWALT branded packaging. The product comes in a heavy duty box so we never repack them for shipping. The typical transit caused some scratches and scuff marks to the box, so when the customer received the shipment the box condition made them think it was a used product. The customer did not open the box to look at the actual product but guessed the condition from the box.
The customer contacted us, we took full responsibility, and solved the problem. We offered to ship another unit and also asked them to look at the actual product inside the box.
Here is the actual feedback posted by the customer. I thought I received a used unit but went to a store to look at one in the box and it was basically in the same condition as the one I received. The seller contacted me within 24 hrs. of my complaint and it was rectified. I would absolutely buy from them again.
The actions you have taken to resolve the issue(s) that caused the complaints about the product condition or description of your items.
According to the customer, he did not intend to send this as a complaint, but to send us an email to inform what he thought about the product condition.
There was no issue with the product condition or description however our shipping department has been advised to rebox all the products that come in a colorful, glossy packaging so there is no damage to the box during the shipping.
The steps you have taken to prevent future complaints about the product condition or description of your items.

1232,"97% Feedback, $100 Million Sold - Our Last Try","If anyone at Amazon is reading this, feel free to reach out to us, as we need assistance with product listing removals due to Used as New complaints.
We are an online retailer that does over $20 million per year on Amazon (over $100 million in sales since we started 5+ years ago) with a 97% lifetime feedback rating. We only use SFP and we are an authorized retailer for all of the products we sell.
In the last year, we have had 40 listings removed due to Used as New complaints. These seemingly automatic removals have taken down products that amount to approximately $2.5 million in annual sales.
To date, after submitting a Plan of Action, we have not been able to get these listings reinstated. Weve only received responses asking for more information. We have had 3 more listings removed in the last 2 days.
We do not sell used products. We package everything extremely well. We take ANY return request back without question and refund in full. We inspect all of our inbound inventory before processing into our stock.
These Used as New complaints seem to be automatically generated by comments that customers put on their return requests. If they include the word scratch or dent it seems to cause a listing to be removed. One of these comments from a customer seems to be able to remove a listing that we have sold thousands of units. Then, when we submit the Plan of Action after inspecting all of our inventory and packaging, we simply get a response to provide more information.
Yes, it is beyond frustrating, but if someone from Amazon is reading this and can actually provide assistance, we are open to working to figure this out.
However, with nobody to contact other than useless Seller Support, it seems Amazon doesnt want us to sell on the platform any longer.",Account Health

 Other relevant information
 Supporting details should you believe the notice was submitted in error or the notices are incorrect
================================
My Plan of Action:
Root cause:
 I have listed brand BRAND1 and brand BRAND2 products without prior consent from the right owner.
 When creating listing there was a gap in the process and did not include step to obtain brand owner consent.
 Wholesaler, from which I sourced BRAND1 and BRAND2 products, is authorized to resell these products, but rights owner was not aware of the fact that I was selling these products.
Immediate actions taken to resolve the violation:
 I have deleted all infringing ASINs and deleted all other products in my inventory to ensure that no longer any product violates Intellectual Property Policy.
 I immediately contacted the rights owner via email to apologies about this breach and let them know I have removed infringing ASINs, ensure they will not be sold in the future.
 I have carefully restudied Amazons Intellectual Property Policy (Intellectual Property Policy for Sellers - FAQ about Trademarks, Intellectual Property Policy for Sellers and Intellectual Property Policy for Sellers - FAQ about Copyrights) to make sure that I totally understand these policies and strictly follow them.
Preventive measures so that infringement does not reoccur:
 Implement supplier review process. Before making a purchase from manufacturers, I will request documentation to be confident that it obtained its inventory lawfully, and that the inventory is not counterfeit. I will exercise extra caution to suppliers who provide incomplete and suspicious information.
 Before listing a new product, I will double check information of such products carefully on the website uspto to make sure that the product follows Intellectual Property Policy of Amazon.
 Before listing a new product, I will contact brand owner asking for permission to sell an item
 I will regularly review product detail page to ensure item is accurately described so that buyer does not have a counterfeit experience
 I will regularly review Amazons guidelines and policies
Invoices and authorization letters
 BRAND1 invoice
 BRAND2 invoice

1235,Need to review my appeal infringement suspension CAN someone please help me,"Dear Seller Performance Team,
I appreciate you for providing me with the opportunity to appeal for the suspension of my seller account due to the complaint of Intellectual Property and infringement.
I completely understand that AMAZON takes these complaints if intellectual property and infringement claim very seriously and I would like to provide you with my plan of action to explain what I will do to prevent similar complaints in the near future.
Root Cause:
We worked with this vendor in the past years and purchased the stock from them as well, docs are attached to this email showing our transaction detail. But in the last few months, the companies quality was going down and prices were increasing a lot so we decided to part way from them and not to sell any products any longer.
We removed the entire asins from our inventory which belongs to the company . But 3 items were overlooked, which is completely my mistake and I take full responsibility for that oversight. The sale history for the items which were overlooked is below:
B00EB86092 sold 2 PC in last 365 days ( documents attached for this purchase )
B00K23XKH0 sold 0 in 365 days
B00KOOEAUS sold 3 in 365 days ( item was dropped shipped from the vendor )
Not knowing some items could slip through the cracks which were infringing or restricted was completely an honest mistake on my part. I should have taken the time and instructed my employees to learn the ins and outs of the selling practices prior to creating any listing and make sure they fall in line with Amazon rules and regulations.
During the epidemic my sales my main manager was tested positive for covid-19 so we had to clear the warehouse and our offices and at the same time we were trying to keep our business going as well, we started to work from home and I was not able to monitor my AMAZON account closely because I was in quarantine.
Also, the company is not aware that the ( our seller name ) are the same company as ****** so there was confusion as well on this issue.
Actions taken to resolve the issue:
I have immediately reviewed the entire inventory and removed any and all listings belonging to the company.
I also have contacted the company and made them aware that ( seller name )is a sister company to ( buying name ).
Every item will be in its correct category to eliminate any confusion for the buyer.
The entire inventor is being reviewed by 2 personnel and making sure items are in line with all vendors we work with.
All inventories will be carefully reviewed prior to creating any listings in the future.
Act immediately upon receive email or any other notification as well.
Reviewed all rules and regulations of Infringement Products Policy. Additional Restricted policy, state, and federal laws for items we are selling.
Monitor Account health on a regular basis.
NEVER EVER we will auto-upload
Actions were taken to prevent this issue in the future:
Before making any listing on AMAZON we will check and verify that products and listings dont violate anyones intellectual property, trademark, copyright, or patent.
I will regularly read and re-read AMAZON guidelines and policies or any applicable laws, which could affect my selling privileges and my account and react proactively.
I will be contacting my ALL suppliers and updating them with our seller name so there will be no confusion.
I will also alert them that we are selling on AMAZON and if any issue or concerns so they can address them to us.
We will also barcode our items with vendors SKU numbers so we can locate the items faster in our inventory so we do not overlook anything.
After receiving this notice, I went back over the AMAZON policies and made sure we are in compliance with all policies, I feel so I have a much better understanding of how to sell on Amazon. I know which items should not be listed and how to create our own listings. I also know how to communicate with seller support in case we need assistance with anything. I would really appreciate your understanding and your reconsideration is much appreciated. Also we just recently took a huge loan with AMAZON lending and I have NO other way of making my payments back to the lending group. I am laid off from my current job and have invested the entire loan amount in my inventory. Please I will be in a bad situation and not be able to sustain my business my only lively hood is this business I am supporting 4 kids and my wife who was also laid off from her job. This was completely my fault.

1236,Impossible? Valid Tracking Rate %,"We requested that our tracking rate (99.55%) be reset back to 100% because of two customers that cancelled before their package was taken to the carrier that day. We complete orders when they come in, immediately, then ship twice daily. These to customers cancelled within two hours of ordering so we refunded, and asked for a refund on the Amazon paid shipping label. Amazon confirms as soon as you print the label.
Here is their responses (haha, logic - or am I missing something):
Amazon - If canceled orders are showing up in your report, its because you confirmed shipment before you delivered the package to the carrier. So, should we take our computer and printer and purchase and print in-front of the USPS carrier??
Amazon - Hence in this case, I kindly regret to inform you that we will not be able to alter your Valid Tracking Rate Metrics as its your fault. also, haha, I kindly suggest you to increase your sales volume with valid tracking numbers so that the defects will get diluted and your valid tracking rate will become 100% automatically over a period of time.

Here is my appeal and in bold are the updates to the original one.
Thank you for your help!
Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team,
First, I want say that I take full responsibility for this policy violation. **
** My goal in this plan is to identify the main cause of the account suspension, how I will resolve the issue, and how I will prevent this issue.
The issue(s) that I believe caused the policy violation to occur:
I created ASIN: B088DHGSB9 on Amazon which unknowingly due to the COVID-19 pandemic now requires approval from Amazon prior to creation.
My failure to review and comply with Amazons categories and products requiring approval along with listing restrictions, led to the deactivation of my Amazon selling privileges. Prior review of these policies would have confirmed additional approvals are required to list these products for sale on the Amazon marketplace.
I take full responsibility for my lack in understanding the pre-approval requirements necessary to offer products in this category for sale on Amazon.com.
I have since removed the affected ASIN along with any product which prior category approval may be required.
The actions I have taken to resolve the issue(s) that caused the above policy violation to occur.
 Immediate removal of ASIN: B088DHGSB9 it will never listed again, which will resolve the immediate problem going forward
 I have conducted a thorough review of my Amazon seller account inventory and have removed all listings which may require additional approvals to sell on Amazon.
 I have conducted a detailed review of the following policies to ensure compliance moving forward:
Categories and products requiring approval. https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html?itemID=G200333160& 3
Category, product, and listing restrictions. https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/200301050
Restricted products. https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200164330?language=en_US&ref=efph_200164330_cont_200316110 1
Policies and Agreements. https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/521
 I have learnt which categories require to obtain pre-approval from Amazon before listing.
 Collectible Coins
 Personal Safety and Household products
 Entertainment Collectibles
 Fine Art
 Holiday Selling Requirements in Toys & Games
 Jewelry
 Join Amazon Subscription Boxes
 Made in Italy
 Music & DVD
 Requirements for selling Automotive & Powersports products
 Services
 Sports Collectibles
 Streaming Media Players
 Video, DVD, & Blu-ray
 Watches
 I learnt how I can ensure to do not accidentally violate Amazons restricted products policies. Now I acknowledge how to list products properly.
The steps I have taken to prevent future policy violations from occurring.
 Ive educated myself about the products that are prohibited from sale, and cant be listed. This includes your Restricted Products policy, including the Examples of Prohibited Listings section. I have educated myself on what those items are to prevent any problems in the future.
 I will only create product listings in categories which I have obtained prior approval from Amazon to do so.
 Prior to offering any product for sale on an existing Amazon listing I will request written approval from the brand manufacturer.
 Contact will be made by phone or email to obtain this approval letter.
 If no approval is granted, we will not attempt to offer these products for sale on Amazon.
 Once approval is granted by the brand, we will review the listing specifications to ensure no additional approval is required by Amazon.
 In the event approval by Amazon is requested we will follow the necessary steps to obtain approval.
 If we are unable to be granted approval we will not offer these products for sale on Amazon.
 Inventory will only be purchased directly from brand / rights owners or authorized distributors.
 I will be regularly checking the condition of my items to ensure that all costumers receive them in a 100% perfect state.
 I will make sure that all items are packaged as securely and carefully as possible to prevent damage during transit.
 To help ensure that I do not violate any more policies, I will also research whether all of my products are accurately described, and correctly listed in the most informative way for any potential buyers.
 Weekly Reviews of:
 Amazon Policies
 Seller Central Updates
 Amazon Seller Support Forums
 Federal, State, and Local Laws/Regulations
 Product Updates and Recalls
** These reviews will ensure I maintain strict adherence to all of the above.**
 New Listing Method: The 3 Rs - Research, Reveal, Review , then Post
1. Research: This step ensures I dont encounter this dilemma again, it will include me, Checking into your policies, All Laws and Regulations, Product Updates and Recalls
2. Reveal: This step is to simply list the idem that Im trying to sell. I called reveal because here is where I reveal everything about the product, such as photos, condition, description etc.
3. Review: The final step is to review what I am trying to list for sale. At this point, I will review all of my research , what I am trying to reveal, and Ill take this opportunity to give my listing one final look over.
4. Post 
Then, my product will be ready to be successfully listed!
My weekly reviews, and new listing method should be my safeguard to fix root cause I the future!
Those collective actions will ensure I can immediately take action, and proactively remain compliant with my listings. Any products that I am unable to verify with 100% certainty, will not be listed.

1239,Pricing policy POA help,"Can I get some help with my appeal? Here is my POA am I missing something?
The root causes of the deactivation was that we are in violation of the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy.
The Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy was violated because we Set the price on a product or service that is significantly higher than recent prices offered on or off Amazon for the following ASINS B004EHZ8ES, B0040ZOMQE, B00YZYTLOS, B00A24NR7C.
I was unaware exactly how the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy restricted you from setting your own prices this coupled with high pricing from the distributor, increased pricing on amazon, adding shipping into my price caused me to violate the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy.
The actions that I have taken to resolve the issues.
I have spoke with an amazon rep who guided me to the following link in order to familiarize myself with the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy.
https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html?itemID=G5TUVJKZHUVMN77V&language=en_US&ref=ag_G5TUVJKZHUVMN77V_cont_521 2
I have reduced the price and will not increase the price above recent prices until amazon has authorized the change in price to an acceptable level by all parties.
I have also removed inventory until this issue can be mutually resolved.
I am actively looking for new distributors that offer competitive pricing.
I am comparing the price to other sites to insure that I am offering a fair price.
I have removed the shipping from my prices and am using amazons shipping template feature to charge shipping for the product.
In addition I have rectified the issues with the listing violations on my account Health for the following ASINS B004EHZ8ES, B0040ZOMQE, B00YZYTLOS, B00A24NR7C
The steps will you take to prevent future issues
I will check prices on other marketplaces before listing any new products.
I have spoken with other amazon sellers and I have added a calculation of Cost + Amazon Fee (12%)+ shipping + 10% (cost of doing business + plus 3% profit) = Price of the product, to my amazon business.
If the price of the product is not competitive with the price on amazon or other marketplaces I will not be listing these items or purchasing them.
I will check prices of amazon to make sure that I am pricing compared to other sellers.
I have read through Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy and I understand that the following a part of violating the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy and will
Refer to the in the future as to not violate this policy again.
Setting a reference price on a product or service that misleads customers;
Setting a price on a product or service that is significantly higher than recent prices offered on or off Amazon; or
Selling multiple units of a product for more per unit than that of a single unit of the same product.
Setting a shipping fee on a product that is excessive. Amazon considers current public carrier rates, reasonable handling charges, as well as buyer perception when
determining whether a shipping price violated our fair pricing policy.
Finally, I would like to apologize for violating this policy as it was not intentional. I truly hope that we can continue to do business together.
Respectfully,
Thomas Stevens

1240,"Account Deactivated - Restricted Products - Holding over $700,000!","Our account was deactivated and Im at my wits end trying to get us reinstated. Amazon is currently holding over $700,000 of our money.
We own 7 beauty supply stores and when the pandemic hit and we had to shut our stores down, we had a warehouse full of truckloads of product, including face masks and gloves. We wanted to help get these products into the hands of people needing them so we posted them on Amazon and sold so many we could barely keep up with the orders.
Then, Amazon decides to put face masks on the restricted products list and we began receiving notices. We closed the listings and removed them from our inventory. We then reached out to the Covid 19 team which Amazon assembled to help sellers get items like much needed masks into the hands of those working on the front lines helping people with the virus. We connected with an Amazon business development rep who gave us a template to list all items we were able to make available. We literally have truckloads of hand sanitizer, gloves, masks, etc. Filled out the template and sent over and the very same day we receive notification our account is deactivated
this is what the notification said:
You have deceptively listed N95 or similar masks in our consumer store. This product type is currently restricted from sale on Amazon.com 1. Items sold on Amazon.com 1 must adhere to all applicable laws and Amazons policies.
How do I reactivate my account?
To reactivate your selling account, please submit evidence or documentation demonstrating that your account has not violated our Restricted Products policy.
How do I send the required information?
To submit this information, please reply to this message. You may also visit the Performance Notifications page under the Performance section of your account, find this message, and click the Appeal button.
What happens if I do not send the required information?
If we do not receive the required information your account will remain deactivated and we may permanently withhold any payments to you. You can see your balance and settlement information in the Payments section of Seller Central. If you have questions about those, please send an email to payments-funds@amazon.com.
Has your account been deactivated in error?
If you believe the products that caused your account deactivation are permitted for sale on Amazon, please include evidence or documentation demonstrating that your account has not violated our restricted products policy and we will investigate your concern.
If we confirm your account has violated our restricted products policy your account will remain deactivated.
so I have submitted a few plans of action - with no success. Ive talked to 4 different seller performance reps and each one tells me something different.
Ive worked with other sellers to get them reinstated and usually, a short plan of action listing root cause, resolution, and preventative is the best format. However, Ive now had two reps tell me to put more into it - give more descriptive explanations.
The thing is - I do not know what they are looking for exactly. Below is the plan I just submitted yesterdayI would very much welcome advice or recommendationsthey are hold 3/4s of a million dollars - its ALOT of money.
Oh and I should add that when we were deactivated, we had 7,000 orders for gloves and when I inquired as to whether we should cancel those orders I was told no, go ahead and ship all the ordersbut Amazon gets to keep our money?
Thanks!
Appeal submitted 5/5/2020
Dear Seller Performance Team,
Regarding our account being deactivated due to reason stated:
You have deceptively listed N95 or similar masks in our consumer store. This product type is currently restricted from sale on Amazon.com 1. Items sold on Amazon.com 1 must adhere to all applicable laws and Amazons policies.
We never intentionally or deceptively listed products as N95 rated. We submit the following information to appeal this decision:
Root Cause
The masks we listed for sale are not N95 rated. We have the FDA registered certification and invoice from our supplier which states they are not for medical use and are intended for civilian use. Please see attached documents.
We never intentionally claimed the masks we were selling on Amazon were N95 rated. However, upon researching our listings, shipped orders, and cancelled orders it appears one of our listings was incorrectly listed as N95.
The ASIN I am referring to is: B086PYYJFG
When our employee added this product to our inventory, during the listing creation process, he incorrectly selected and joined an already existing listing, adding us as other sellers also selling this product.
He selected this listing as the image shown was the same as our product and the title had no brand name assigned to it. Our product also was not branded. It was purchased directly from the manufacturer, had generic packaging, and was not a brand specific item.
The root cause of this issue stems from a combination of errors we made:
We joined a listing that stated in its title that it was N95 rated when, in fact, our product was not rated N95. Had we provided more in-depth product education; our employee would not have joined this listing as it did not accurately describe our product.
We failed to train our employee to check the restricted product list before adding it to our inventory to ensure it was not considered a restricted product. Our employee assumed that the listing he was joining complied and did not violate Amazons restricted product policy.
The root cause of this issue is we failed to provide adequate training to employees working in Seller Central.
We did not provide enough product education. Had our employee been fully educated on disposable masks, he would have known this product was not an N95 rated mask.
We also did not train our employee to make checking the restricted product list the first step when adding a product to our inventory in Seller Central. Had he checked restricted products, and been properly educated on the product, he would have known N95 masks were restricted, and he would have not selected a listing claiming the N95 rating.
We realize our inadequate training is the root cause of this issue.
Resolution
We closed the listing and deleted it from our inventory.
We canceled the 38 orders placed for this product. Fortunately, no orders were ever shipped to customers.
Realizing this issue stemmed from our failure to properly train our employees, we implemented new policies and procedures within our company. All employees assigned to tasks related to Amazon are now fully trained on Amazon regulations and restricted products policies.
Employees who work in Seller Central are now fully trained on the restricted product list  where to find it, how to look up a product, and the first step of adding a product to our inventory is to check the restricted product list. When adding new products to our inventory, if the product already exists in Amazons catalog, before adding it to our inventory they must go to the listing on Amazon.com 1 and ensure the listing content accurately describes the product and that none of the content is in any way violating Amazon regulations.
Employees are now provided in depth product education. We have live product education meetings during which we provide extensive detail for each product we intend to list on Amazon. They must understand the product before they can assess an already established listing for accurate product description or, if not found in Amazons catalog, create a product listing that accurately describes the product.
Every person working in Seller Central has now been taught the importance of providing accurate product details, checking the restricted product list prior to adding a product to our inventory, and reading every single detail of already established listings to ensure they are compliant and that they are, in fact, the exact same product we are listing to sell.
Preventative Measures
To ensure we are always fully in compliance, we have created a new position within our company and have filled it with a trusted employee. The position is Product Manager and it is that roles responsibility to know all the laws, regulations, and necessary certifications etc. for every product. That role also includes new product research, before even considering creating a product with our factory, we must first know all of Amazons requirements for that product type. It is this roles responsibility to ensure our Amazon team workers are fully educated on the product and new listings are fully compliant with Amazons policies.
And last, but not least, we will perform audits 4 times a year, checking every listing to ensure it has not been added to the restricted products list and that our listing content is in compliance with Amazons listing requirements and regulations.
Future with Amazon
Pending reinstatement, our plan is to longer sell masks, or any other product related to the Covid 19 pandemic. We will sell only beauty and nail related products.
We appreciate your review of this appeal and hope our account will be reinstated. We value our ability to sell in Amazons marketplace and never intentionally set out to deceive or abuse our selling privileges.

1241,Confused about Soap- Restricted products. Need help,"Hello
We received a performance notification that some of our long time selling soaps were removed from Amazons inventory as they are restricted products under the new COVID-19 restricted products update that include soaps.
Here are few of them:
Florinda Magic of Flowers White Moss Vegetal Soap Bar 100g 3.5ozB07C446N6Z
Florinda Flowers White Moss Vegetal Soap Bar 1.76 OuncesB07BT4BJTY
Florinda Fruits Passion Mandarin Vegetal Soap Bar 100g 3.5ozB07C3NSDPN
Florinda Flowers Tuberose Vegetal Soap Bar 50g 1.76ozB07C3Y725S
We close the listings and we close the listings on all our soaps as requested in the notification (around 1500 products)
We open a case with Seller Support and we received the following advice:
You need to complete the form below to sell soaps
https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/covid-product-approval/requestForm.html?language=en_CA&ref=ag_xx_cont_GU5H4KPBMUFE6XHH 5
We completed it and sent it 10 days ago, no answer. Anyway this is for NEW listings and ours are not new. We contacted seller support again and they gave as the following advice:
Requirements for listing existing Personal Safety and Household products
When applying to sell existing products, you will be asked to provide some or all of the following:
At least one purchase invoice for the products from a manufacturer or distributor
Photos of the product or its packaging
Consent to [Amazons Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy]
Ok that is good we thought: we have invoices, authorizations, photos, even FDA VCRP-s, etc, we have everything.
But where to actually SEND all the papers? We could not find an answer and we are going around the tail for 10 days now.
Adding existing product from inventory is not working as these products are removed from Amazons catalog and we can not find them to add them.
Anybody know where we can send all the papers have these products reinstated?
Also we have around 1500 regular soaps shower gels and shampoos listings closed because we do not want to receive performance notifications for them too. We also have documents for them and we dont know where to send them.

Additional info on how I got here
When I opened my Seller account I registered to open for the US, Canada, and Mexico even though the only one I needed to open one for the US but I thought it may not hurt to also register these two regions as well.
As soon as I registered, I received a message from Amazon saying they are reviewing my account and my selling privileges have been removed. I received the same message from Amazon for Canada and Mexico as well. What they required for the review was a utility bill to prove my identity. I provided my companys internet bill and that worked. My account was reinstated for a short period of time and then revoked again this time for the reason stated above. The same above message appears on both the Canada and Mexico regions.
Before this I had another seller account but was suspended for similar reasons, but because I did not provide the right information that Amazon wanted when I appealed I ended up receiving the kiss of death reply. For months Ive been trying to get the original account reinstated through multiple appeals but there have been no response from Amazon. After I contacting the Support team, they suggested I open a new account which is what I did because there appears to be no way for my to reactivate my original account.
The problem is that Amazon is now telling me I have to reactivate all accounts. How can I do that if Amazon wont reply to any of my appeals from my original account? Can I resolve the issue with the new account alone?",Account Health

1246,Deactivated Best Seller but cant appeal (yet),"I just received a seller performance notice that my best selling item has been de-activated because of a complaint that the item listing or condition was not accurate.
This is from a Used Item Sold As New complaint that is the result of a UPS mis-delivery, where the unintended recipient opened the boxed, scratched the product, and then forwarded it to the customer a few days later.
We are the brand owner, manufacturer, and shipper, so our POA path is very clear and straight forward - however this ASIN is not yet appearing in my Seller Dashboard:

1247,Can You Check My Appeal?,"We received your submission but do not have enough information to reactivate your account at this time. To reactivate your account, please send the following:
 Greater detail on the root cause(s) of A-to-z claims, negative feedback and service chargebacks.
 Greater detail on the actions you have taken to resolve A-to-z claims, negative feedback and service chargebacks.
 Greater detail on the steps you have taken to prevent A-to-z claims, negative feedback and service chargebacks going forward.
 Greater detail on evidence or examples that demonstrate that your account has complied with our policy.
Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team,
 Greater detail on the root cause(s) of A-to-z claims, negative feedback and service chargebacks
I did not perform proper quality control measures by opening and testing all the functions of an item a buyer returned as defective to make sure it was in fully working condition before reselling it. Because of this, the new buyer received a damaged/defective item
I trialed third party order fulfillment for some recent orders, having them be responsible for packaging and shipping the item. This third party shipped orders and provided tracking information overly late and because of this, some orders arrived late and another went unreceived by the buyer
I failed as a seller in my understanding of how to handle returns, leading to customer complains. This was because I responded to return requests by trying to troubleshoot and clarify the buyers intentions, which did not adhere to Amazons policy of buyers being able to return anything for any reason within 30 days
I failed to confirm delivery on a package by checking the associated UPS tracking information. Because of this, I was not aware when UPS did not deliver the item to the buyer
I failed to cancel an item as the buyer requested before it was delivered, causing the customer to have to go through the process of returning the item once they received it. This lack of prompt action on my part and mishandling of the situation caused the customer to leave negative feedback
I was not clear and/or did not comply with Amazons shipping estimates. I updated the buyer with a new delivery date that did not match Amazons estimate, when I should have instead refunded/cancelled the order for being unable to deliver in the promised timeframe
 Greater detail on the actions you have taken to resolve A-to-z claims, negative feedback and service chargebacks.
For the granted A-to-Z claim regarding late on-item delivery, I followed up with the customers response to return the finally-received items from the carrier, responding to them within 24 hours with our return address
For the A-to-Z claim related to the defective item, we responded to the buyers messages promptly (on the same day received), and eventually provided our full return address to the buyer to assist with his return request
For the negative feedback and service chargeback, we examined the buyers reasons: One buyer was dissatisfied with having to wait for the item to be delivered before returning it, while another was dissatisfied with the item being delivered late. After responding to both buyers messages, one withdrew his A-to-Z claim and we promptly issued a refund for him, while for the other we replied to the alert email on time with all the information we possessed, including providing proof of signature
I made changes to our seller fulfillment methods immediately ending the third party fulfillment trial responsible for late and undelivered orders authorized all buyer returns made within 30 days, and checked our inventory for out of stock issues
 Greater detail on the steps you have taken to prevent A-to-z claims, negative feedback and service chargebacks going forward.
Re-adjusted how I handle buyers opening return requests, so that if they open a return request within Amazon policy, they will have their return immediately authorized as per Amazon policy
I will improve our handling of general customer service issues, by setting up a system that alerts me throughout the day when we receive buyer/seller messages
Preventing negative feedback and service chargebacks by initiating a daily end-of-day check to ensure that all orders required to ship that day have been shipped. This ensures buyers orders are shipped on time, and they can remain fully informed where their order is in the delivery process
Applying a thorough quality control inspection process to every buyer-return item, consisting of opening the package and testing the items multiple functions to confirm complete working condition, before the item is put back up for sale
Confirming product packaging is intact and sealed on items I list as New to prevent the issue of selling buyers potentially defective items
Applying an inventory check performed weekly, to ensure no out-of-stock issues
I will make use of Holiday Settings when I expect to be unavailable, to ensure that our products are not on sale when we arent able to promptly complete orders
I will be closely monitoring our accounts metrics to ensure that we meet all the performance targets as set by Amazon
I will follow all Amazon policies
Yours sincerely,

1248,Account suspended for unauthorized item,"Hi my account was suspended for selling an unauthorized item. I filed a POA explaining that the reason was that I only relied on the sellers app to list and I didnt check with seller central. I also included that in the future I will check with seller central and with manufacturers before listing. i did not write anything for the actions taken to fix problem and my appeal was denied. Below is the copy of what I sent. Can someone look at it please and tell me why it was denied and how I can fix it?
Cause:
. I did not verify via Amazon Seller Central that I had approval to offer these products on Amazon or that I had been pre-approved to do so. I relied only on Amazon seller app to determine eligibility. Above issues and not being up to date with amazon polices regarding listing restrictions led to unauthorized and inauthentic products being listed on amazon for sale.
B: Actions taken to fix the problem:
I did nit put anything here. But I will put the following in next appeal:
1.I double checked my inventory for all ASIN to make sure that they do not need authorization.
2. I deleted the listings that required authorization which I did not have.
C: Actions taken to prevent this type of issue in future:
I will check with amazon seller central for approval before listing any products
I will follow up with brands for authorization to resell their items on amazon.**
I will constantly check with amazon for any updates on brands that require authorization or any changes in the listing polices.",Account Health

It happened on the same day when I received an email saying my UK account is under review. I believe UK account verification pending was the root cause to trigger USA account suspension.
Now, my documents are complete, UK account get verified to sell and in good standing. However the USA account has not recognized UK accounts verified status for account reinstatement.
Story Timeline:
Dec 31st 2019: USA account get approved.
About Jan 6th: checked UK option under Amazon Global Selling.
Feb 10th : UK account under review (Your Amazon seller account is under review sent by seller-performance@amazon.co.uk - For your security, we have suspended your Amazon seller account. During our review, you will not be able to sell on Amazon.)
Feb 10th: North American accounts suspended (Your Amazon.com selling privileges have been removed - We found that your account is related to an account that may not be used to sell on our site. As a result, you may no longer sell on Amazon.com)
Feb 25th: submitted additional doc to Amazon UK (internet billing, Business Registration ordinance).
Mar 7th: submitted additional doc to Amazon UK.
Mar 17-19th: submitted additional doc to Amazon UK (phone billing, Certification of Incorporation).
Mar 20th: UK account get approved (Your information is verified  Start selling on Amazon now sent by seller-verification@amazon.co.uk)

Great Thanks from the bottom of my heart!!
23rd March (my appeal):
Root Cause:
We figured out the root cause of the US seller account suspension is due to
the linking UK seller account being put under review since 10 Feb 2020
(then we received the email about US account suspension on the next day).
Resolution:
After went through a month of identity verification process in the UK seller
account, Amazon UK has verified and approved our account 20 March 2020.
In this regard, we would like to request US account re-activation immediately. Thank you!

Thats the whole E-Mail. Now this is me asking for advise here on the forums.
Looking at this one: B0086FSKY4
My price was $6.95 and Amazon is now the only seller at $7.48. So, when my price was lower than Amazons, how is that a listing violation?
Looking at this one: B01B6NTES8
My price was $8.65 which is extremely fair. After shipping depending on the location of the buyer I believe the profit is less than $1. I see there are no other sellers now, so I am guessing a bot turned off everyone selling on that listing. But once again, I didnt change the price and I dont see how this would be considered a violation for any reason.
Looking at this one : B01LJ3J3GI
My price was $6.95 and I do not recall ever even changing the price. Theres no way to compare it as there are now no other sellers on this ASIN either.
I did what the E-Mail said to and read the fair pricing policy. I had actually read it before some time ago.
When I click on Appeal under account Health and Pricing Policy Violations the wording of the appeal makes it sound like I have to admit to having set an unfair price, but I never did.
Any advise would be appreciated. Its bad enough to get warned for doing something wrong when you didnt and now I am growing a bit fearful of trusting so much of my business to this Premium amazon store.

1262,Forced to Appeal Infringements?,"We got fed up trying to get anyone at Amazon to realize that our wording was within legal and Amazon trademark parameters on about 20 items. So we removed the products from our inventory months ago. A week ago we were called by a rep who said, get this, we Have to file appeals in the account health section or our account will be deactivated. After arguing that we dont want to appeal and the products no longer exist on Amazon she still made us file the appeals! So we did, just writing that we dont want to appeal and dont want to sell these items on Amazon.
Now we are being told the appeals dont have supporting documents and we are going to have our account shut down.
This is ludicrous. No one is reading anything we write and we only get automated responses from seller-support and anywhere else we try to get a human to do human things.
Very frustrated.",Account Health
1263,How are you supposed to prove you arent associated with bad accounts when Amazon gives barely no information?,"Basically, Ive been associated with a number of bad accounts and I am somehow supposed to prove they are not me and/or I do not know who they are.
The first time I was able to talk to someone about it, it was only one account. But follow up calls, that number has grown to three, then finally five. At this point, I fully expect that number to grow to ten in the next call.
But the only information I can get from account health is what I guess are the first three characters of the email address. Not where I was associated with them. Not a name. Anything useful. The reason why that would help is because I have logged into my account at various places. Home (obviously), my work computer and laptop via work WiFi (different IP addresses) and via my laptop at the in-laws. I suppose its possible I have done it elsewhere, but I cant recall. Not to mention wherever I may have been on my phone through the seller app. Could be church for all I know.
I partially get not wanting to give information that might be someone elses. But the fact that same information is the basis for incriminating you. Itd be nice to have something than the information given that barely crosses the threshold of not being useless.
Would love it if it were possible to sign an NDA to see what is there or even an I promise these arent me note.",Account Health
1264,Infringement appeal. Amazon taking a long time to respond?,"Hello everyone, my account was suspended due to the infringement violations. Mostly these are generic products, that you can order from any Chinese seller, but they have their ways of getting rid of competition. Anyway, I digress. Short story, I had listed my products under existing ASINs which I at the time thought was the right thing to do. I received policy warnings, but since those were simply from competitors, I figured theyre just threatening me in order to get rid of me; I also didnt know you could appeal those. So I received the message below:
Hello,
Your Amazon selling account has been deactivated. Your listings have been removed. Funds will not be transferred to you but will be held in your account while we work with you to address this issue. Please ship any open orders to avoid further impact to your account.
Why did this happen?

After a few back and forth rejections, asking for more greater detail, I took the advice of some Amazon reps on these message boards and finalized my Action Plan below:
Dear Amazon Team,
I am responding to a request to submit greater detail on:
Greater detail on the root cause(s) of the infringement.
Greater detail on the actions you have taken to resolve the infringement issues
Greater detail on the steps you have taken to prevent infringement going forward.

ROOT CAUSES OF INFRINGEMENT:
The root cause of this problem is incorrect and incomplete understanding of the Intellectual Property Rights Policies, by our employees and owners (myself and my husband). This was due to insufficient training in Amazon Policy; this includes Amazon listing policies, intellectual property policies, copyright policies, and overall selling procedure. We take 100% responsibility for this insufficiency.
Due to the lack of complete and proper training of Intellectual property rights policies, proper attention was also not paid to the product detail page. This resulted in failure to certify that the: item, description, packaging, UPC, is a complete match to the ASINs listing page, so that buyers can make an informed decision and receive exactly what they ordered.
We failed to contact the owner of the intellectual rights to the items listed under the ASINs in question. We failed in seeking permission to sell said items and obtain proper documentation which would allow us to list the products, and present such documentation to Amazon.
We failed to provide proper oversight of our employees in order to ensure that proper procedures and policies are being met, before a problem could arise; this is a failure on my part as owner
ACTIONS TAKEN TO RESOLVE INFRINGEMENT ISSUES:
We have completely ceased the sale of the following items: B06XXDB7DG, B06XXGYNBM, B082LSL47T, B07T1HJN1N, B07T5RLLSM, B082DD6CZV, B07PQVXPY8, B082FTT785, B07CVSZ58G, B07T2HQ32C. .
In addition, I have proactively gone through the remaining of our inventory listings and closed all active listings that may be in violation of intellectual property rights, in order to eliminate further notices
All unbranded items in our inventory have been sidelined and will not be re-listed in order proactively avoid further infringement issues.
In an effort to resolve the infringement issues, I have personally contacted the following owners, with an apology and explanation. I also included a request for retraction.

PREVENTION:
In order to be in 100% compliance with Amazon Intellectual Property Rights policies and all other seller related policies, we have completely overhauled the way we do business, and the following measures have been put in place:
First and foremost, we have hired legal representation on retainer, in order to avoid and catch future conflict, before the listing every gets to Amazon. This will give us expert input on the dos and do nots of Copyright Infringement laws
We have dramatically reduced the number of employees with access to listing products, from 6 employees down to 3 (two owners and one manager).
We have printed and handed out policies
We will create our own product listing for our unbranded items, with its own ASIN, under our own acquired brand, and will never use another sellers product detail page, so that we can avoid customer confusion and infringement complaints.
The Intellectual Property Policy for Sellers - FAQ about Trademarks pages have been printed and handed out to every person under our employ. Reference link: https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html?itemID=ZUQ6GBBXQVHQKF2&language=en_US&ref=ag_ZUQ6GBBXQVHQKF2_cont_G201361070
If we are selling a similar or identical product to other existing listing, we will follow
We have implemented a new system of oversight. This requires TWO people to sign off on every item listed. Whomever lists an item, is required to seek approval from either one of the owners, or the manager on duty.
Future product purchases made from distribution companies need to be accompanied with documentation which either shows the product(s) to be non-trademarked, and/or must provide us with a re-seller certification so that we can operate within the parameters of the infringement policies
We now understand the seriousness of this matter, and have created a new bookkeeping system to keep records of purchase orders, invoices, receipts, and other documentation, in order to prove legal purchase and authenticity of goods.
Treasure Grotto has ceased ALL operations with manufacturers whom are unable to provide documentation that clears the manufacturer from violating copyright laws, before the product(s) ever make its way to us
.
We have invested a great deal of effort and time to establish our company as a reputable seller on Amazon. We take pride in our quick deliveries and I hope to continue being a part of the Marketplace. These problems have become a wakeup call and we will now be much more diligent in our policies regarding items we list on Amazon.
Our experience has been very positive and we hope that you will trust us to do better once re-instated.

When submitting the appeal, it states itll take 1-2 days for replyit has been almost a week and no reply thus far. What gives? Are they just behind and backed up? Did they forget about me? What exactly do I do? Thanks

1265,Identical Product? False infringement?,"Hey,
So I am the seller of a generic product; meaning that it isnt owned by any one company or entity. So, Amazon seller policy states that before creating a listing, I MUST search and make sure it doesnt already exist in the catalog. So lets say that Im selling a generic makeup mirror. So I search Small round lighted makeup mirror. I find 100s of listings for the same exact item, however, I notice ALL of the titles have some odd name in front of itsuch as TCT Small Round Lighted Mirror, and WeSell Small Round Lighted Mirror, Hiashu Small Round Lighted Mirror, and now imagine an endless list of different names to the same exact item. Furthermore, I noticed that some of the listings change a tiny, completely trivial detail in the product detail page, for example: One seller ships the mirror in a clear bag, another seller ships in a black bag, another in a blue bag, someone else might include a little wipe cloth for the mirror"", endless tweaks. So, I click Sell item, and suddenly I get a barrage of emails from Chinese people, demanding and threatening me unless I remove my listing from their ASIN. Finally, they do it enough times, that my account gets suspended. Now they ask for invoices and POs, but heres the catch: When you purchase GENERIC items, they are typically sold directly from the manufacturer IN China, for example, from Alibababut Amazon wont accept POs in Excel form, which is how they invoice you. Amazon wants invoices and POs from companies like Shark, or LG, or some certified distribution companyand I get this, IF the item werent generic, and was a protected brandbut its not. I cant get an invoice from Hiashu, or WeSell, or TCT (the sample brands I listed above), because they dont EXIST. They are not real brands! The items are generic!
So, what on earth does a little ant like myself do I in situation? Id love it if an Amazon rep could respond to this, as well.
Thank you

1266,10 day LSR over 4% but 30 day LSR under 4%,"Hello everyone, we have been a long time seller and have come across some issues with amazon carrier this past weekend. Our amazon carrier failed to pick up this past Monday and on Tuesday only made a partial pick up. This resulted in 12 late orders. Our 10 day LSR is at 5.29% (violating amazons under 4% policy), but our 30 day LSR is at 3.03% (still good). Our question is, should we be concerned that our account may be deactivated? or should we wait another 10 days for the percentage to go down? Also, is there any way to file a claim or appeal for the orders that were marked late?

Hello from Amazon,
We are writing to let you know that the following detail pages have been removed from our catalog:
ASIN: B086D6NDV8, SKU: 18-684F-Q7QE, Title: ""KN 95 2pc""

Please note Selling Partner Support does not have further guidance. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we navigate this global crisis.

If any of the above ASINs are Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) offers, please initiate a removal request for the ASIN(s) referenced above to have your inventory sent to a location of your choosing. If you fail to initiate a removal request within 30 days of this notification, we may dispose of it in accordance with the Amazon Services Business Solutions Agreement and FBA policies.

Failure to properly close or delete all restricted product listings from your inventory may result in the deactivation of your selling account, and funds may be permanently held.

1271,Seller Account Deactivated,"Hi- Im hoping someone can help me. My account was suspended on May 1st. Amazon said that it was for an issue they had emailed me about previously. Thats it. So I figured it was some listings where I had received Fair Market Policy violations (esp. since I received a potential pricing error about 30 mins before my suspension). I will post the suspension notice below.
I appealed but no response for two weeks. I figured my POA was insufficient so I wrote a more detailed POA and submitted again. Still nothing for another week. Finally yesterday I received an email stating
Based on our records, you may have product listings that were removed due to non-compliance with Amazons Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy. When we originally removed your product listings, we shared that you could appeal for listing reactivation through your Account Health Dashboard on Seller Central.
We are writing to inform you that we have updated the process for reactivating your product listing(s). You no longer need to submit an appeal or wait for a decision from a previously submitted appeal to have these products relisted.
I have long since deleted all of these ASINs from my inventory since I believed them to be the source of my suspension. I now suspect I had the source all wrong. I think it was due to a Restricted Listing violation I received in April. It was for a papaya scented lotion that they said contained a lightening agent that I was not authorized to sell. This is a mistake as it is just an ordinary lotion by Natures Gate. I never appealed it bc I only had one and figured it wasnt worth my time. I did not realize it affected my account health.
My questions are, do you believe that I am correct in thinking I had my suspension reason wrong? If so, how can I write a POA for a violation that was incorrectly given? TIA

1275,Infringement suspension (on 2nd apparel),"To our sellers and Amazon,
I recently submitted my 2nd plan of action to Amazon and the following is my letter to Amazon. Please advice.
""To whom it may concern,
After receiving the respond from Amazons Seller Performance team, we have revised our plan of action to ensure that this would not happen again.
The roof cause of the issue:
Lack of respond to Performance Notifications
Amazon does not allow listings that violate the intellectual property rights of brands or rights owners. (infringement)
B000JJSKZ4- SKU: 4CJH1V003A9F was donated to us for resale. And we listed SKU: 4CJH1V003A9F as a good condition used copy before confirming if SKU: 4CJH1V003A9F is authentic. (Please refer to attachment B000JJSKZ4 for case details)
B00AQSN67A- SKU: 4CJKFS000WAM was an authentic sealed copy that was donated to us for resale. And we listed SKU: 4CJKFS000WAM as new by accident. (Please refer to attachment B00AQSN67A for case detail)
B00ATP24XC- B00ATP24XC was never listed for sale with us and was never in our inventory (Please refer to attachment B00ATP24XC for case details)
B0090C63W8- B0090C63W8 was never listed for sale with us and was never in our inventory (Please refer to attachment B0090C63W8 for case details)
B00132D7TA- SKU: 4CJGZ4001ZIE was an authentic used copy that was donated to us for resale. (Please refer to attachment B00132D7TA for case details)
The actions you have taken to resolve the issue:
So to resolve the issue, the following is what we are doing:
Lack of respond to Performance Notifications
As a new operation manager for the department, my contact info has just been updated in the account. We manage the account base on customer service, metrics, and we werent reviewing performance notifications like I should have. We honestly thought that the notifications would fall into our message box which is responded to within 24 hours, and we did not know that notifications fall somewhere else. From now on, I will monitor and respond to performance notifications daily. I am truly sorry for not responding.
Amazon does not allow listings that violate the intellectual property rights of brands or rights owners. ( infringement)
All Listings with issues has been closed, and we also remove those items from our inventory. Added SKUs to reject list on system to ensure that we would never list the item again. We disable the list item as new feature to ensure that all items are listed as used. Added Quality control pre-sort process which includes the following steps to media listings. We went thru the complete media inventory to pull all items that can become potential issues.
Look carefully at the cover
Image quality
Incorrect spelling
Cover quality
Examine the actual DVD
If we can see thru the DVD
Hold the DVD up to light to check for manufacturers name
Check for thickness of the disc
All open infringement cases have been responded to, and apparels have been submitted. We are currently reach out to publishers contact listed as well. We will be waiting for a respond from them. There may be delay in their responds due to current situation.
Please refer to following attachments for more details on action taken to each individual cases:

B00ATP24XC  apparel submitted  contacted publisher
B0090C63W8  apparel submitted  contacted publisher
B00132D7TA  apparel submitted  contacted publisher
The steps you have taken to prevent the issue going forward:
Respond to performance notification right away if action needs to be taken
Disable list as New feature
Remove potential Item with issue from our inventory
Added SKU to reject list on system
Block all items from listings that are on the reject list
Added a pre-sorting staff in place to ensure condition / quality of the item
Please refer to following attachments for more details on steps taken to each individual cases to prevent the issue going forward.

The drill is nice for a beginner or someone that just want to do miner nail work but would not recommend for a salon setting. One great thing it did not get hot but there were times the bit slipped out which made me worry about the dust getting in the drill. Nice for home use.
I sent a request 2 times to remove feedback, since this is about the quality of the goods, but Amazon did not delete the feedback by sending this answer

1280,Suspended account . Related to another account which is suspended,"Hey guys I am here for a little advice on a topic a lot of you seem to be having. Any help is greatly appreciated.
My simple problem now seems a lot more complicated then originally thought. I had a seller account for about 2 weeks and everything was going fine. I got a call from an amazon rep asking how everything was and had a good conversation with him. After that I saw all my applications for other marketplaces (europe/japan/uk) open up. About 5 minutes later my amazon account was suspended saying I am linked with an associated account who does not have seller privileges. I went back and all the accounts were suspended and deactivated. I subsequently downgraded my sellers account to disable the other marketplaces. I was confused and then did countless research on the topic.
I now find out it that was most likely not the issue. As everything had been going well with the store my dad who lives at my address wanted to try his luck out selling as well. As a 65 year old with not the greatest computer skills I helped him set up his account on my computer. We wanted to keep separate accounts in the first place so we can keep tax liabilities separate and obviously dont want to interfere with each-others stores. His account was activated a day earlier but then subsequently deactivated because I assume that he is now associated with my account (which is now suspended). We set up with different cc, different telephones, emails and 2FA authorization. My first appeal was not very good as I did not realize how to properly put an appeal in motion. It has not been a week yet but am trying to get as much information for my second appeal. Going forward I realize we both need dedicated computers for selling, separate cc, email, bank account information, and phone numbers which is no problem and we do want to keep everything totally separate which is why I did not let him use my store in the first place.
First question I have which seems to be hard to answer is what is the true reason I got suspended(the other marketplace or setting up my dads acct) and another other information I can get on resolving the situation. I was looking forward to selling on amazon for years and this is a big problem which seems can get me banned forever.

Additional information
I understand my listing has been deactivated because I was selling Tyler Gallon Wash for MAP pricing from Tyler candles which is higher than some others that is being sold on Amazon. I do understand that Amazon wants to have the largest selection for buyers at the lowest prices available. However, I cant compete with people selling it for $68 on Amazon site because it is close to what I pay for it after shipping to get it to me. Amazon fees etc. I wouldnt make anything off of it. Tyler Candles Gallon wash is supposed to sell for $95 a Gallon but if you buy 3 or more you can sell them for $90. These prices are set by Tyler Candles. I listed mine at $84.95 which is below what they tell us to sell it for but was hoping to not get a phone call from them.
My pricing is the comparable to online off Amazon prices.
Website was listed here - Gallon wash $90
Website was listed here - Gallon wash is $90.
Website was listed here- Gallon wash is $90.
I have sold this product on Amazon for about 2 years. I get my product directly from Tyler Candles and it is authentic.
For this item I am not able to sell it on Amazon because I just cant compete with the pricing on Amazon. Therefore, I have deleted my listing for :
UPC: 803821381118
EAN: 0772195385971
According to the Fair Market Policy, I have compared prices on and off Amazon to make sure all my listing price is within Amazons guidelines. I have made sure that if I am selling multiple items, they are not more expensive than the cost on a single item bought multiple times. I have researched the products I am selling on and off Amazon to make sure I am selling them within the guidelines. I have repriced some of my products and just deleted other products because they did not meet Amazons policy. Before listing any new items, I will make sure that I am following the policy and selling at a competitive price.
In the future and according to the Fair Market Policy, I will to compare prices on and off Amazon to make sure my listing price is within Amazons guidelines. I also need to make sure that if I am selling multiple items, they are not more expensive than the cost on a single item bought multiple times. This will ensure that I am still within Amazons Fair Market Policy. I will continue to monitor other sellers and their prices on and off Amazon to make sure my prices are within limits. I will continue to search outside sources/ other online sellers sights to make sure my prices are within limits of the fair market pricing policy. In the future I will continue to look at these listed sites to ensure I am within the limits.",Account Health

1287,Suspended - 2 accts. - suggestions pls,"So i opened 2 accts which i now know is an issue. Let me give you the back story as to why and then let me know youre recommended thoughts on course of action.
So in Nov. I opened this acct. as a new seller to get things read to launch, tinker and be ready for 2020.
I started with a couple gtin exemptions but there were issues with both and after going around for 5 weeks with CS we still werent remotely close to a solution.
example 1: i had a exemption in Toys but every time i started adding the product it kept associating the ASIN with some random product.
example 2: similar issue, but upon adding the product it assumed I was listing under another similar product and added my info to the catalog but nothing ever appeared and it still should have been a brand exempt listing unique to me.
anyways, it was like communicating to no one with no forseeable resolution. I assumed the acct was cursed and decided to open a new acct and repopulate the GTIN data from the minor mistakes I made on this acct. In that short but quick amount of time all previous issues on acct 1 werent an issue on acct 2. All GTIN exemptions were processed perfectly and immediately.
On acct 2, its suspended as well but their reasoning there is that they cant verify my utility bill which makes no sense as its very straight forward an electricity bill. I dont know if its flagged because of this acct as well, or what, but they keep saying unverifiable utility bill.
So what do I want? I appealed and asked to close/delete acct 1 so i can use acct 2 which has no issues, so to speak. As mentioned Im a new seller, never sold a thing, was just trying to get things up and running for RA and have an inbound order ready for FBA.

Thanks
To Amazon Seller Support,
Thank you for inviting us to draw up a plan of action and appeal for getting our account
reinstated. Firstly, I want to make it clear that I take full responsibility for the suspension of the
account. My goal in this plan is to identify the main cause of our account suspension, how we
will resolve the issue, and how we will prevent this issue.
The reason you are listing products that you are not approved to sell:
After analyzing the current situation regarding the suspension of my account, I recognize where
I went wrong. My selling privileges were removed because I made the following mistakes:
 The main reason behind our account suspension was the listing of an items that is not
permitted for sale on Amazon.com without approval.
 I didnt act within the time frame to review and delete the listing that did not comply
with Amazon policies.
Steps you have taken to resolve this issue:
 We have reviewed amazons list of prohibited products. We have removed all non-
approved items and restricted items.
 We have gone through one by one and reviewed all of our items for sale on amazon and
checked them to ensure they are compliant.
 We have removed any additional listings that were found to be in violation of any seller
policies.
How you will prevent this issue in the future:
 We will carefully review Amazon policies for Restricted Products and applicable law
before listing a product. We have learnt which categories require to obtain pre-approval
from Amazon before listing.
 We have implemented a companywide compliance policy to make sure any product
listed on any ecommerce website, including Amazon, is in compliance before it is listed.
We have trained each employee on how to utilize the Amazon Performance page.
 I will set aside 1 or 2 days per month to educate my employees and together review any
updates to Amazons policies.
 From now on, our company has implemented precise rules and business practices that
will prevent our company from violations.
 We will be monitoring all new rules and policy changes that apply to products in our
category. We have now required employees to check weekly on any new Amazon
policies and rules.
 We have required employees to visit Selling Central University and to stay informed and
up to date with the last products that are restricted and that require approval.
 Employees who work in Seller Central are now fully trained on the restricted product list
 where to find it, how to look up a product, and the first step of adding a product to
our inventory is to check the restricted product list. When adding new products to our
inventory, if the product already exists in Amazons catalog, before adding it to our
inventory they must go to the listing on Amazon.com and ensure the listing content
accurately describes the product and that none of the content is in any way violating
Amazon regulations.
 Employees are now provided in depth product education. We have live product
education meetings during which we provide extensive detail for each product we
intend to list on Amazon. They must understand the product before they can assess an
already established listing for accurate product description or, if not found in Amazons
catalog, create a product listing that accurately describes the product.",Account Health
1289,Used Product Being Sold As New (We Are the Brand/Manufacturer),"Hello. We just had one our product removed from Seller Central for a customer complaint used item sold as new. I sent in the following response that was rejected:
What caused customers to complain about the condition of your items?
Brand X is the manufacturer of these products. The consumer states that the product they received was used. We NEVER sell anything that is used, EVER. ALL PRODUCTS ARE NEW . We manufacture our own products.
What the consumer received was a product that was likely not completely full because it leaked. In the box they received 2 items- 1 bottle with a hose end attachment and 1 refill. The bottle with the hose end was the one leaking. The refill was not leaking.
What have you done to resolve the issue that caused the customer complaints about the condition of your items?
We have addressed the leaking hose end bottle issue. Amazon recommends bottles to have a seal underneath the caps, so that is exactly what we have done. Consumers will now receive 2 bottles with seals underneath the caps to avoid any leaking even if the cap comes lose or the package is not handled properly by UPS during transit. And the hose end piece will be in the box but not attached. The consumer can attach the hose end before use.
Brand X is a Vendor Central Supplier of a version of these same items.
What actions will you be taking to prevent future complaints about the condition of your items?
Brand X has test shipped products to assure there are no more leaking issues. Brand X will continue to carefully watch the shipping of the products to make sure there are no more complaints about leaking. The quality control team will make sure all products have the seal underneath the cap and are properly boxed with bubble wrap for less movement during transit.
Amazon wants invoices but we are the manufacturer of the product I made that pretty clear in the first submission which was rejected.
Any thoughts on what else we can do?",Account Health
1290,Extremely strong POA rejected,"Hello,
Here is my POA for a suspended account due to ODR being over 1%. Upon rejection I called Amazon twice and both Health support agents admitted that my appeal is very strong, however they dont have a solid idea as to why it was rejected. I need help here please.
Plan of action to reinstate selling privileges
On August 15th 2019, my Amazon selling account had been deactivated due to the following four reasons: (1) the item delivered was either damaged or defective; (2) the item delivered was different than that of which the buyer had ordered; (3) a package did not arrive or arrived late; and (4) negative feedback received from an order that had been cancelled. My team and I recognize the gravity of these claims and are aware that our ODR (order defect rate) is above what is tolerated as sellers. This POA will therefore address the root cause of each of these claims, the actions we have taken to resolve the issue and finally, the steps we will to prevent such issues from recurring.
(1) Damaged or defective item:
A. Root cause
 Buyers received damaged or defective items due to our poor package handling and failure to weed out defective products from our wholesalers, respectively.
 Firstly, from the moment they were packaged until the delivery, some orders were not handled according to our standards and procedures by our employees or the courier company. This not only caused packages to look damaged upon arrival but caused actual damage as well.
 Secondly, because defective products from the manufacturer are quite rare, for example as a result from production errors, we accept full responsibility for failing to have an active quality inspection process and allowing defective products into our inventory.
B. Actions that have been taken to resolve this issue
 We contacted each buyer and based on the buyers preference, we either processed a full refund or sent a replacement of the item free of charge.
 For greater detail on evidence that demonstrates how such actions have been taken to comply with Amazons policies, please refer to the following orders:
o Order 112-4312133-8129868
o Order 111-8061919-3661039
o Order 112-0349051-6544275
 We have individually inspected all current stock and removed any defective items.
 We have implemented a quality inspection process when all products are received from our suppliers to ensure that defective items are removed from inventory promptly.
 We contacted our suppliers regarding issues with receiving defective products and to inform them of our new quality inspection process.
 We have revised our package handling policies and procedures and reviewed these with all staff.
 We have evaluated our shipping materials and made changes where needed to ensure protection of the item from our warehouse, through the courier and shipping chain, to the Buyer. For example, we now wrap fragile items in extra bubble wrap or tape (depending on the item) and make sure to stamp the box indicating its fragility. This further ensures all future parties in contact with our package to handle it with greater care.
C. Steps to prevent such issues from recurring
 In response to contacting our suppliers and informing them of the gravity of the issue, they have reassured us that all items will through greater inspection on their end, in hopes of preventing this issue from recurring.
 We will continue to inspect all received inventory for any damage or defects, before adding items to inventory.
 We will continue to assess the effectiveness of our shipping materials in protecting items from shipping damage.
 We will continue to monitor closely our Account Health, Seller Feedback, customer products reviews, and Buyer messages for any problems.
(2) Delivered item different from order:
A. Root cause
 The root cause of delivered items being different than those ordered by buyers is a direct result of internal warehouse organization.
 Specifically, we have many variants of the same items in our warehouse stock. For example, one item can be purchased in numerous different colors or sizes (ex: ASIN B00MIAVLBW). Instead of strategically dividing the placement of these items within the warehouse, all items were disorganized and scattered amongst others.
 As a direct result of our poor organization, the items packaged for delivery were different than those ordered by the buyers.
B. Actions that have been taken to resolve this issue
 In order to resolve this issue, our team immediately contacted buyers about the options available for resolution: to refund or to replace the product sent with the correct one. We noted their concerns and fulfilled their preferences.
 For greater detail on evidence that demonstrates how such actions have been taken to comply with Amazons policies, please refer to the following orders:
o Order 112-5593655-1219414
o Order 112-3654252-0980244
o Order 112-8160765-3571442
 We restructured and reorganized our warehouse to properly divide and subdivide all items in their respective colors and sizes to ensure order accuracy.
 We have assigned two of our warehouse employees who will double check packages for verification to ensure that they match the description on the label (size and colour), approximately 30 minutes prior to package pick up.
 We have increased our customer service availabilities to answer all messages from 9am to 6pm ET, 7 days a week.
C. Steps to prevent such issues from recurring
 Upon arrival of new items, we will add color stickers to the boxes matching the color of the item to facilitate the accuracy of the order process and creating a double verification.
(3) A package did not arrive or arrived late:
A. Root cause
 The root cause of packages not being delivered was due to considering FedEx delivery confirmations as proof of delivery.
 After contacting FedEx, they informed us that there are two possibilities to explain why packages were never actually delivered even though the tracking information stated otherwise: either because FedEx left the package at the wrong address or because FedEx left the package at the buyers residence without knocking and someone stole it.
 The root cause of packages being delivered after their estimated delivery time was due to poor internal organization. All labels are printed at 8am and ready to be placed on the securely wrapped packages by our warehouse team.
 Packages were not always ready when the courier trucks were being loaded since there were not enough warehouse employees working and they did not have time to pack up all orders on time. Additionally, some workers arrived late to work.
B. Actions that have been taken to resolve this issue
 If a package was delivered late due to our poor execution (ex. Order 111-5625382-8506646), we apologized and refunded the buyers.
 If a package was never delivered even though the tracking number confirmed receival by the buyer (ex. Order 112-0782269-9297052), we apologized and refunded the buyers or sent them a new product, depending on their preference.
 We have scheduled more than one daily pick-up later than the usual time by our courier company to prevent late shipping.
 We have hired 3 additional warehouse employees to make sure all the orders are packed up and ready to be shipped and fired those who were arriving late.
 After reviewing our handling times and shipping templates, we chose to update them to 2-3 days instead of 1-2 days. We additionally informed all of our warehouse employees of this change. This will allow a bigger time frame for our employees to properly arrange for the packages to be ready on time and prevent late shipments.
C. Steps to prevent such issues from recurring
 I studied these policy pages so that I know what Amazon policy is and can follow it. (Policies and Agreements (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/5218))
 We will constantly monitor and track all orders to ensure that they have been scanned and picked up by the courier.
(4) Negative feedback from cancelled order
A. Root cause
 We had to cancel orders because we were out of stock, due to failing to verify the actual count of items received from suppliers, versus the quantity ordered.
B. Actions that have been taken to resolve this issue
 We verified our in-stock quantities for all currently listed offers and changed the status of out-of-stock SKUs to inactive due to zero inventory.
 We now hand-count each order of inventory to verify the quantity received from suppliers. We use this hand-count to identify our quantity available for purchase, for every SKU.
 We implemented a new strategy to update our inventory every Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday, and make sure that every active SKU is correctly represented in Manage Inventory.
C. Steps to prevent such issues from recurring
 We will constantly monitor our inventory and additionally require that all warehouse employees immediately confirm the catalog team of when items go out of stock.
 In our inventory page, we will use the sort availability feature of all active listings and once a product has a quantity of 5 or less in stock we will mark them as inactive until we receive a new batch from our supplier.

Hello,
thank you for bringing to our attention that our account may be somehow connected to a fraudulent or suspended account. Let us just start off by saying that even though this suspension creates a burden on our legitimate business, we appreciate and understand the effort that Amazon undertakes to remove fraudulent and malicious sellers that harm Amazons customers.
We take full responsibility for this suspension and have looked into all possible causes of why our account could have been linked to another account. Those possible causes and the process of our investigation with attempts to resolve them are listed below:
*Closed Amazon Seller account in the year 2016
At the end of March 2016, our first Amazon Seller account in Europe was closed due to changed general regulations and Amazon Seller Europe decided to stop working with companies based in Slovenia due to tax reporting related issues. We were unable to access the account after that. Up until this year, we worked together with other companies petitioning the Slovenian Ministry of Finance to change the problematic clause in order to be able to start selling on Amazon Seller account again. In case there are some old listings from our closed account (2016) we were not able to find them on Amazon while actively and searching for them. If there are any old listings, they are not active, meaning we are not fulfilling any products for Amazon Seller platform at the moment.
After that, we have decided to open an Amazon Seller account in Europe with our subsidiary company XXX based in the United States of America. After going through a three-month hustle of getting a European based tax number and going through the process of verification successfully and listing the products the account was suspended with no option to appeal. The email used for this account was [xxxx] This happened before we shipped or sold any products. We were unable to find the possibility of entering the account to properly close it in case there was an option.
After the Ministry of finance changed the clause, Amazon lifted the restriction in 2020 and as a result, now allows companies based in Slovenia to sell on Amazon Seller platform. Firstly, we have decided to try to activate the same account which was suspended in the year 2016, however that, unfortunately, was not possible. Consequently, we have opened a new Seller account in Europe, USA and Australia, eager to distribute our products to customers around the globe.
After a notification (8th of May 2020) of successful verification of Europe Seller account, we got a notice that the account was suspended. Some of the email addresses added in the Seller account were the same as in the previously suspended accounts are the following:

At the time we were unaware that we need to put the stated email addresses under related accounts and had done so promptly.
We do not wish to have multiple Amazon Seller Europe accounts open. We only desire to have one functioning one. Since the previous ones were closed with no option to reopening them and have not been accessed for years. As far as we are aware and have checked our files and emails there are no withstanding issues needed to be paid from our side.
*Multiple accounts
We wished to start selling on Amazon Seller account Europe, USA and Australia. However, we have opened three different accounts. We were at the time unaware this is not acceptable. We have now added all linked accounts under related to be in accordance with Amazon rules and to demonstrate the transparency. Please refer to beneath picture, demonstrating that all accounts are linked. The key user is iand was further given permission to [ xxx ], [ xxx ] and [ xxx ]as they are all part of our Amazon sales team and will be committed to providing astonishing customer service for customers.
*US account owned by our official partner
*Accounts from other team members
Currently, the team at our company counts 40 members. We have asked everyone individually if they have a personal account on which they sell or have sold something in the past. We have also asked them to not browse Amazon from company address in order to avoid any possible clash or a red alert with IP. We havent found any current member of the team who operates on EQUA company address who would have a personal selling account on Amazon.
*Verification details review
In case the verification details were put under review we have carefully checked them again and you can also see all of them listed below in the attachment:
Valid Government-Issued Photo ID of a beneficiary owner;
Copy of either the Bank or Credit Card Statement translated in English;
Utility bill (Internet Bill) translated in English;
Business operating license;
Signed notification from the business register (a change of legal name and HQ address).
*Steps we will do and did to prevent the issue happening again:
-Before listing any new items, we will verify that they are compliant with Amazon policies and applicable laws;
-To help us assure that we do not violate any policies we will collaborate with Amazon Seller advisor at all times;
-We will regularly review the Amazon policies again in order to be in trend with any updates and changes with applicable Amazon policies and laws;
-We will look at the credit card issue again and provide a valid credit card for monthly payment;
-Keep all our accounts healthy;
-Not use multiple Amazon accounts at the same time;
Add all accounts into related accounts.
Please consider the appeal carefully as we honestly have not and will not take any actions that may harm Amazon or its customers in Europe nor Australia or around the globe. We believe that we can be an above-average Amazon seller with above 98% lifetime positive feedback score, with minimum defect rate and a minimum refund rate. We believe that by stating the above reasons (especially providing you with distinct sales record with Amazon Vendor Central), we are credible brand for Amazon Seller platform.
We give credence to this plan as we are confident that the plan itself sufficiently explains the issue. We are looking forward to having our selling privileges restored.",Account Health
1293,Failed Account Reactivation,"Hello,
Our account was deactivated this Fall after my company severed ties with our broker partner.
I came on board in the past month and attempted to reactivate the account. This was the instruction I received when I clicked to reactivate the account:
_How do I reactivate my account? _
Please provide the following documents and confirm that there is a valid credit card on file:
 A bill that is dated within the last 90 days for piped or natural gas, electricity, piped water, or internet service with name and address visible
 Business license, if applicable.
The name and address on the document must match your name and address in Seller Central.
I found a gas bill that matched our Business Address and Official Registered address, but I just noticed we had an old Legal Entity address in our Account Information under Settings. Also, we do not have a business license, so I uploaded the Tax ID. As I mentioned, we were previously an active account, and do not have a business license, so I dont think that would be needed.
After a couple days, I received the error message below:
We have reviewed the document(s) you recently provided but do not have enough information to reactivate your seller account at this time. We were unable to verify the document(s) you provided because you did not provide all pages of the document, provided screenshots, or did not show all of the required information. During our review, you will not be able to sell on Amazon. Funds will not be transferred to you but will be held in your account while we work with you to address this issue. Please ship any open orders to avoid further impact to your account.
Why is this happening?
Your Amazon seller account has been deactivated in accordance with section 3 of Amazons Business Solutions Agreement. If you currently sell on Amazon, we need additional documentation to verify your payment methods and your identity.
How do I reactivate my account?
Please confirm that there is a valid credit card on file, and provide the requested document(s) in .pdf, .png, .jpeg, or .gif format. These documents must be authentic and unaltered.
The name and address on the document(s) must match your name and address in Seller Central. Please certify that you have provided the document(s) in one of the supported languages. Supported languages include: Arabic, simplified Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Turkish.
Do you think it was rejected because:
The bill address did not match the Legal Entity address?
I inadvertently uploaded the tax ID?
I did not upload a Plan of Action?
Other reason?

1295,Account Suspension,"From Amazon to me on May 3:
You have violated of the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy
They of course suspended my account.
My first submission:
May 3, 2020 2:08 PM PDT
The root cause of the issue
I did not have have access to these items, so I added a #1 in front of it so
when we open again, I can just delete the #1 instead of having to do
inventory to add these items back. For example, if something cost $10, I
added 1 in front to make it $110. I did not think any customer would make
such a purchase and did not realize I was violating Fair Pricing.
I apologize for my ignorance and I have now corrected the problem.
Would never do that again.
Thank you.
The actions you have taken to resolve the issue
Same as above.
The steps you have taken to prevent the issue going forward
Same as above.
Submission 2
May 8, 2020 4:09 AM PDT
Additional information
Root cause of issue:
I did NOT have access to some of our inventory due to our warehouse being
closed down. I thought that if I add a 1 in front of the price of these items, it
would prevent customers from buying them.
For example, if an item was listed for $17, it is now listed as $117.
I have since went through each and every item and corrected my mistake.
If I dont have access to products in the future, I will adjust inventory to zero
instead.
It was an honest mistake due to my ignorant about Amazon Marketplace
Fair Pricing Policy. I have now read and understand Amazons pricing policy
and will not violate it in the future.
I appeal again on May 19:
I am making this appeal to reactivate my account. The root cause of why my account was deactivated in the first place is because I did NOT have access to some of my inventory due to our warehouse being closed down. I thought that if I add a 1 in front of the price of these items, it
would prevent customers from buying them as most of these items were under $20.
For example, if an item was listed for $17, it is now listed as $117. I did not realize that by doing this, I was violating Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy.
The action I have taken to resolve this issue is I have gone through each and every item and corrected my mistake. Furthermore, I have now read and understand Amazon Marketplace
Fair Pricing Policy.
To avoid this from happening in the future, whenever I dont have access to my products, I will adjust inventory to zero instead of adjusting the price.
I would highly appreciate it if you could consider my request and reactivate my account.
Thank you so much!
Amazons response:
We have opened a case to address your issue. A team member will follow up with you as soon as possible. We answer most emails in less than 12 hours

1299,Account Under Review - Is this reason legit?,"Has anyone had this issue before? Our account has been in-review with funds being held since May 3rd. We received an account review notification from Amazon (full notification email is below) on May 3rd. I replied with all the requested info on May 4th and received the reply Your account is still under review. We ask for your patience while buyers leave feedback for you. Then on May 20th, I received the same Your account is in review email requesting the same information a second time.
Things to note about our account:
We are not a new seller. Weve been on the Amazon.ca site since 2015.
*Our account ODR is .38% (1 out of 256 orders), which was 1 negative feedback asking where his refund was. This buyer never returned his item and all of our emails to him go unanswered.)
*Amazon recently increased our buybox percentage a few months ago because our seller performance ratings were good.
*Voice of the Customer rating is majority of listings Excellent, with only a few categorized as Good
*We have no other AtoZ claims or customer issues reported against us.
How is it legal to hold our funds because buyers are not leaving feedback? Buyers are not obligated to leave feedback on their orders and if no one is responding to Amazons automatic feedback request email, how is that our ultimately our fault or any reason Amazon should use against us to hold our money? We have now missed 2 transfer dates: may 6th and may 20th. So our funds are being held for a minimum of 4 weeks at this point.
Has anyone had this issue and what was successful in getting the review lifted?
We are reviewing your account. Funds will not be transferred to you during the review but will stay in your account. Please continue to ship your orders and only list items that you can ship by the expected ship date.
Why is this happening?
Your current sales volumes are not supported by buyer feedback or an established sales history. As a result, we are reviewing your Amazon.ca seller account.
You may be able to expedite the process by sending us the following information, as applicable:
How long you have been in business.
Anticipated monthly sales on Amazon.
The address (URL or store address) of other stores where you sell these products.
Tracking information for recently shipped orders.
GSTIN, VAT ID, Tax ID, or Dun and Bradstreet (D-U-N-S) number.

1300,New North America Seller Account Deactivated After Inadvertent Sign Up For Global Program,"I recently signed up for a new Amazon North America account. After going through verification I was quickly approved and after logging in, I was intrigued by this global selling program with Amazon. Inadvertently I may have automatically signed up for EU and JP markets. Luckily I was able to decline Japan market but now the account is deactivated because the EU account is related to my US account. I only intend to sell within the US, so now going through the process like everyone else. Others are experiencing the same situation as there might be a glitch in the system signing us up for this promotion.
Others have mentioned from Account Health teams that we reactivate all global accounts and then ask to close them all. After this we proceed with putting in an appeal with our primary account (North America). Others have stated dont close the global accounts since it will also close down North America account (accounts unified) (unsure if true or not).
I am currently in the verification process and sent in (comcast utility, credit card bill, US passport, US drivers licence, screenshot of payment taken from UK for professional account) with everything matching my exact address.

1301,Help with used as New POA,"I have no idea what to do here This is my 3rd attempt at writing the POA and each time I get the exact same canned response from Seller-Performance without any further direction on what it is that Im missing from my POA.
We purchased 70 units of this ASIN: B0868XNC33 . The UPC code for this part had not existed on Amazon in the past so we created the product page from scratch and spent the time to add A+ content to go along with it. Not only that, but we also spent over $1,500 USD on advertising. Then suddenly a random used as new complaint comes in and our listing is de-activated immediately without any chance for us to act proactively Apparently a great waste of my time and money.
Its impossible for us to have sold used as new because we have only purchased this product once before and it was NEW, direct from the manufacturer. We did allocate 7 of the 70 units we purchased as New Open Box because some of the retail boxes came in slightly damaged. We received the slightly damaged retail boxed units as NOB and sell those under the Amazon Renewed Product page attached to this ASIN. Other than that, everything else in our stock is brand new with MFG warranty.
Heres our POA:
What caused customers to complain about the condition of your items?
Improper seller preparation on Order ID: 114-5630365-6553037 / ASIN: B0868XNC33
Our shipping team mistakenly included an Amazon Renewed warranty card with a NEW product order. We include the Amazon Renewed Warranty cards inside of the shipping box. This caused the customer to believe they received a used/refurbished item instead of new because the retail box was opened by our shipping team and a Renewed Warranty Card was dropped inside the box.
What have you done to resolve the issue(s) that caused the customer complaints about the condition of your items?
We responded to the buyer via buyer-seller messaging and verified the serial number on the product they received is NEW and has a manufacturer warranty. We explained to the buyer that the Amazon Renewed Warranty card was included with this order by mistake. The buyer did not have any further objections.
We then sent a notification to our shipping department Manager and explained the situation. We asked our Shipping Manager to provide their own written POA as to how they will prevent this from happening again in the future. This is a response from our shipping team: We will no longer put these cards inside the box, instead they will be put into the packing slip envelope by our quality control person, to avoid putting this in an order that doesnt require one. 
Things we could or should do: We will perform a secondary stock-check to physically verify the condition of the inventory in our warehouse. We can also replace the item if the customer requests it.
The steps you have taken to prevent future complaints about the condition of your items.
We have taken the time to review and fully understand the following guidelines as written by Amazon:

Seller Performance Team,
To better understand the issue of inauthentic claims, weve performed an in-depth review of requested ASINS.
The root cause of the issue
Our sellers privileges have been removed for a review because we have listed items that we are not approved to sell. There are pre-approval requirements for the branded items we were listing. I consider the reason of that:
I. We were not aware that we are not allowed to sell items by This Keeps That Safe, Contineo and Balance World Inc without actual approval.
The actions you have taken to resolve the issue
Action we have taken to resolve the issue:
I. Reviewed all of our listings to make sure they are correct.
II. We sorted out and discarded all the items that did not meet our quality standards.
III. We have contacted the original manufacturer of the items and confirmed with them that the items were real and authentic.
IV. We deleted ASINs B07JRC12CW, B076VL7TZH, B01KE18WMW and have deleted additional ASINs that dont conform to Amazon standards.
V. Fully read the Amazon Policies regarding Categories and Products Requiring Approval found at https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=14113001&
The steps you have taken to prevent the issue going forward
Actions taken to prevent this issue in the future:
I. We will not list any items under ASINs or categories that require approval unless we have verified in advance.
II. We will do a throughout review of every ASIN before adding to Amazon inventory.
III. We have updated our process to check all of our listings regularly on Amazon to ensure the information is up to date: product title, description, pictures.
IV. We will always provide invoices for each of our item to show the authenticity. Before packing the order, we will examine it thoroughly to verify that the product is authentic and has outstanding quality.
Please check my Plan of Action and help me with this problem, me and my team are going with all amazon rules and will go with them further.

Submission 1
April 1, 2020 6:10 PM EDT
The root cause of the issue
I didnt adhere to Setting a price on a product or service that is significantly higher than recent prices offered on or off Amazon (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G5TUVJKZHUVMN77V)
The item was B07NQT3Z3G (Kleenex Trusted Care Facial Tissues, 1 Flat Box, 144 Count (Pack of 1)), and I was selling it for 12$ pus shipping 4.99$.
However later I lowered the price to 8$ later (plus 4.99 shipping)
Amazon didnt allow to sell this product (B07NQT3Z3G) due to Fair Pricing Policy
So I put quantity 0 (zero) of this product to avoid selling it

The steps you have taken to prevent the issue going forward
I will not intentionally raise my prices to engage in any price gouging of any form
I reviewed all other ASINs in order to avoid the same issue
I bought subscription of Keepa application (Keepa.com) that can tell the historic prices of particular item, so when I list the item to avoid significant price disparity between the listed price and average historic price, and the lowest price of competitors on Amazon.
I will continue to stay educated and informed concerning Amazons Fair Pricing Policy. I will ensure that I am up to date with significant points because Amazons Policies are always subject to change for our marketplace at any time.

1307,Used sold as New Appeal - Where to submit?,"Yesterday the listing for our top revenue item, a product we manufacture and have been selling on Amazon since 2013 was shut down due to a Used sold as new violation.
I am working on crafting an appeal based on the super-useful tutorial thread by @Shelf_Cleaning_Capit How to Handle Used as New Complaints Version 2
Prior to submitting the appeal - or even posting it here for review I have 2 questions:
Should I request a Bin check prior to submitting the appeal?
If so should I wait until the bin check is complete to submit the appeal, how long do those usually take?
How do I submit the appeal? I dont see any way to submit the appeal to Amazon.
The issue is not yet listed in our Account Health Dashboard and the link from Action Required: Listing Removed from Amazon.com 1 email leads to the performance dashboard. I can confirm the listing is closed, if I attempt to edit the listing from the FBA inventory dashboard I am shown:

1308,Account at risk help!,help please my account is at risk of be suspended I called this morning and they gave me an email but I lost the paper it was something like product compliance does anyone has it.,Account Health
1309,After 17 Years: URGENT: Your Account is at Risk For Deactivation,"Ive been a pro seller on Amazon for 17 years. Through thick and thin. I sell books only. I received a notice today from Amazon, as I have copied and pasted below. Apparently I received one too many customer complaints in the last 6 months (3 total complaints out of over 6000 books shipped) that supposedly I had sent them a used book when I had listed it as a new book. I never personally heard from these customers, so I dont even know what their specific complaint even was. I suspect its possible that a competitor may be lodging false complaints against me to get me suspended, but I have no way of proving that. I have shipped books immediately, 6 days a week, and answered all emails in a very timely manner. My Order Defect Rate is .09% (1/1107) in the last 60 days. That was for 1 order that for some reason I must have misplaced the book somehow and couldnt find it anywhere when it was time to ship, so I had to cancel immediately.
Now I am being told by Amazon that I must submit a Plan of Action in the next 72 hours to keep my account from getting suspended. I have no issue with submitting a plan of action, except for this: They are asking for Invoices from my suppliers for the specific ISBN numbers of the books for which I received complaints. Keep in mind, I purchase my books from a wide variety of sources, and I purchase large quantities in order to receive the best prices. I have literally NO way of submitting any kind of invoice that shows the purchase of any specific ISBN numbers from ANY of my sources. I spoke with an Amazon Customer Service Rep this morning as soon as I received the email. She seemed somewhat sympathetic, but still insisted on the invoices.
Am I completely screwed here no matter what, without any kind of invoices? Ive never been through any of this before. And Im stunned that with the metrics that I have, and the track record and service record that Ive carried for 17 years, that it has come to this. Any assistance is appreciated. Here is the email I received from them:
Thank you for speaking with us about your Amazon selling account.

Complaint ID: 7014429801
I responded to the email address in the complaint with invoices and this is the response i got.
To help explain the inauthentic claims you received from Amazon; During a recent e-commerce review, we found that you are/were incorrectly listing as the brand Camellia. These listing were identified as infringing on our intellectual property rights as the beans being sold are the Camellia Brand beans and qualify as a Counterfeit as defined by Amazon. L.H. Hayward has also found many seller are improperly using images owned outright by our organization, not for public domain. We are proud to be a Louisiana small business since 1923 and have worked hard to maintain our brands quality and value. In order for us to protect our products and our consumer experience, we are committed to protecting our intellectual property through all of our sales platforms, including e-commerce.
In addition to numerous issues with photography, intellectual property, improper item descriptions, we have also found out of date, damaged, and other quality issues reflecting poorly on our Camellia Brand products. For these and other reasons: your seller account was not the only one affected: we are actively engaged to have all Camellia Brand products gated for exclusive sale and do not intent to approve authorization to those seeking to resell on Amazon. Any further purchases of our products that are intended to sell on Amazon may result in products that you are unable to sell as originally intended, which of course we do not want to see happen. We understand that you may have inventory on hand and want to allow you time to restructure. We ask that you (or any of your affiliates) stop selling our products before June, 4rd 2020. After this, if you continue to sell L.H. Hayward products on Amazon, we will end our relationship with you as customer.
We are delighted that you and your customers see value in our products and certainly encourage their use. Unfortunately, we were not aware that you were reselling in the current/recent capacities and we do not allow this.

Below is my 2nd POA just sent them with some sales receipts/packing lists from the supplier.
Dear Amazon,
We appreciate this email to remind us about our selling performance on Amazon marketplace. During the pandemic, our personal business is affected so hard. That is a main source of our income. We took this hard time to address those issues carefully. And we also took steps to improve our selling performance for future. Please let us take this chance to explain about those issues.
All those items that we sent to customers were in new/unused condition with original factory packaging. Unfortunately, those items listed in you guys email might have factory defects: minor scratches, nicks, broken factory seal even theyre in sealed packages from factory. We only knew about those defects until customers opened packages and reported to us. Those items were not definitely used/installed items.
To resolve those issues for our customer satisfaction, we sent new replacement items ASAP or issue full refund with extra credit to those customers as our sincere apologies. We also provided clearly explanation to customers about those issues.
To prevent future complaints about the condition of our items:
Here is our plan of action to ensure buyers will receive those items in perfect condition in the future.
Plan of action:
Before getting an item to sell, we will make sure the item is from a reputable and trusted source.
Our items will be free of damages, because we will inspect each one as soon as it enters our warehouse and will list them only after such an inspection.
Items functionality will be carefully tested in all aspects exactly before they will be shipped to customers.
We will ship only in high quality boxes and depending on the item, we will use high grade bubble wraps for all items and make sure packages dont come apart when shipped. All items will be packed safely and securely to insure no damages occurs during transit. Photos will be taken for quality check.
All orders will be shipped out by our trained employee. All employees involved with packing and shipping will undergo periodic training.
Any item in the future that may have a problem will be immediately taken out of inventory.
In case if item arrived damaged or defective, we will give buyers an option to receive a refund or send them a replacement with buyers prior consent. We will refund them immediately, and will provide prepaid shipping label where applicable.
We will contact manufacturers to help buyers with any item defected by the factory.
Please see below for details of our POA for those items that affected.

Complaint type:
ASIN:
Sincerely,
Seller Performance Team
At the beginning, I clicked Appeal in account health and submitted invoices for review. Then I received an email that they couldnt identify the ASIN in my inovices. I replied back with explanation and circled in screenshot because the ASIN is one item of set and the invoices only show the set. Then I received an email back asking for further information such as below
We received your submission but do not have enough information to reactivate your listings at this time.
Please send the following information for the items listed at the end of this email:
 Supplier information (name, phone number, address, website)
 Buyer information (name, phone number, address, website)
 Item descriptions (for ease of our review, you may highlight or circle the ASIN(s) under review)
 Item quantities
 Invoice date (must be issued in the last 365 days and before 04/25/2020)
I replied as much information as I can provide but I didnt attach my invoices again. I thought they might use the invoices I sent at the beginning. Now I found there is a limit to upload files in Appeal button. Im still not sure what is the reason that I still got back with insufficient information. Are there real person who deal with the review or just machine?
Whats worse now, their final email saying that Your listings will remain deactivated and we may not respond to further emails about this issue.
Does anyone know the right email address to contact to a real associate in Seller Performance Team?
I was trying to get in contact with seller performance team to get my case reopened but there is no response. It is frustrating because I do have enough proof to provide authenticity of our items. I just would like to communicate a right person to get this resolved.",Account Health
1321,Amazon double standard on restricted items,"I sell glass items that are intended for tobacco use only(also stated in my listings)
I am 1 many sellers in this niche , my listings are exactly the same description,keyword etc as the Chinese sellers. I continually get blocked from selling these items and violations on my account from these items.
when these items are sent in FBA and a disposal order is made or return comes back for a customer Amazon lists and sells the SAME item on the SAME listing.
How can my account continually be targeted and held to a different standard as the Chinese sellers and Amazon? I dont get a straight answer for why these listings are marked as restricted. Im getting fed up",Account Health
1322,"POA declined for the third time, NEED help!","One of our ASIN were removed because of condition complaints. We sent POA and invoices to Amazon. The 1st time we got rejected like 5 minutes, we added more details and submit the second time and got rejected after 1 day. We added more details and submitted, then got rejected several hours later for the third time. The following are our third POA. Any suggestion will be much appreciated. The ASIN is a all in one computer.
The root cause that led to the complaints about the condition of our items
Our listing for ASIN B********* was suspended due to product condition complaints. We reviewed the entire 121 orders including review, feedback, return comment, voice of customer and message for this ASIN and found the following customer complaints.
(1) Order --***. The return reason is bought by mistake, and the customer did not open the package when we received the return.
(2) Order --***. Buyer Comment: item is defective, not working. We called the customer to confirm that that defective was due to damage done to the screen of the computer during transit
(3) Order --***. Buyer Comment: Was not delivered to my home, as ordered. I cannot pick it up from USP facility.
(4) Order --***. This is FBA order. The return reason is carrier damaged.
The complaints helped us realize the root cause is that we did not put enough protection and packing material for this product before shipping. Since this product is all-in-one computer, which is over-sized and heavy, the hard drive or screen of the computer is easily damaged during shipping if we do not provide extra protection and the package can be easily damaged during shipping, which makes it very easy for the customer to consider it as a ""used"" item.
The actions we have taken to resolve the issue(s) that caused the complaints about the condition of your items.
We filtered the above four orders on Amazon that are related with the ASIN. We took the following 3 steps to provide better experience for the customers:
We deactivated the ASIN and related products ASIN listing that might cause complaints
We explained to the customers what was our mistake,and the steps we took to prevent it from happening again.
We made sure all customers received full refund or free replacement/upgrade to their choice of computer.
Packaging
We required warehouse workers to put more cushion and packing material in all-in-one computer packages, wrap the computer individually and securely seal the package using a stronger seal tape called kraft tape.
We stopped shipping all-in-one computers with only original manufacture package, but inside a bigger box with enough filling materials as extra protection.
Shipping:
We enhanced our shipment quality control by double checking every package condition before being shipped out. Every package will be checked by two workers separately to make sure the package is well protected and shipping damage in transit can be completely prevented
We inspected all the inventory for the ASIN and relevant products in the warehouse, and picked out the units that are not in a perfect package condition. We returned them back to the manufacturer instead of sending to our customers. These units might be damaged already during the transit to our warehouse.
We also hired 2 more warehouse workers and ordered more frequent carrier pickups so that every worker has enough time to pack and ship each order with perfect protection even if we have large amounts of orders daily.
The steps we have taken to prevent future complaints about the condition of your items.
Sourcing: Are you sourcing the product from a trusted supplier that sells items in new condition?
Yes, we source products directly from the manufacturer DELL.
Listing: Is the product accurately described on Amazon? Have you ensured that there is no ambiguity and the customer is well informed?
Yes, the product is accurately described and customers are well informed.
Packaging: Is the product in its original packaging as listed on Amazon?
Yes. However, the package can be damaged when the manufacturer ships them to our warehouse. Therefore, we take the following actions to prevent future complaints.
We talk to our account manager at Dell about the condition problem of the items they send to us and the complaint that our customers have, and request them to be more rigorous and careful about the package. We also discuss with them about the carrier they work with and packaging option to prevent future shipping damage. We request them to stop working with carrier Laser Speed,LLC, and started to work with UPS and Fedex. We also request them to ship using pallets instead of individual box to prevent shipping damage.
We upgrade our inventory management system to record packaging condition of every unit from the moment they arrive at our warehouse. Packaging condition is required for every unit in the warehouse and will be stored in the system. This way, any units from manufacturer that are not in a perfect condition can be filtered out and kept away from our inventory, and will not be shipped to customers. For every order shipped out, the serial number of the item will be scanned to make sure the packaging condition follows Amazon condition guidelines.
Shipping: Have you taken all appropriate steps and quality checks to ensure that the product is stored, packed, and shipped appropriately, and will not be damaged when shipped?
No, we did not do enough, but we take the following steps to prevent more complaints.
We started to operate a 2-step quality control in our fulfillment process.Every shipment will be double-checked by two warehouse workers who handles sorting and packing individually.Each staff are required to record the condition and serial number of the product to prevent item that does not meet amazon condition guidelines being shipped. Whats more, all the fulfillment process of each order will be video recorded. If we get any future complaint or feedback from the customer, we can easily identify the staff that made the mistake through serial number matchup and video clips. This will push the staff to strictly follow Amazon condition guidelines.
We ordered thousands of oversized corrugated boxes (30""x24""x18""/26""x20""x18""/20""x18""x18""), these boxes will fit all the all-in-one computers and desktops we sell. We will ship desktops and all-in-ones inside these bigger boxes so they can be better protected. We also purchased ""Fragile. Handle with care"" sticker for all the packages to remind carrier staff to handle them carefully. We believe that the complaint for desktop and all-in-one computers will decrease dramatically this way.
We hire an account heath manager, who is responsible for checking messagereviewfeedback,return comment on a daily basis, once we receive any negative experience from customer. We will take actions immediately to prevent it happening again.
We make a one hour training session based on Amazon condition guidelines that all the employee, especially the warehouse worker, must learn and follow
We will declare value for every package so that the carrier will be more careful handling the package
We purchased ELECTRONIC KRAFT TAPE DISPENSER (Model H-1036) from uline for a more secure sealing since kraft tape is much more strong than regular tape. This will prevent the seal being damaged during shipping",Account Health
1323,Retraction Submitted - How long does it normally take for reactivation?,"Hi guys,
A competitor withdrew their complaint against my company to notice-dispute@amazon.com

Any idea how long it could take for my account reactivation? its been 2 days now. Just curious when I can go back to getting a normal nights sleep. Im thinking about sending my competitor a nice gift. Ive lost over 20 pounds since my suspension so my pool body is all primed and ready.

1324,Account at risk of deactivation!,"Hi all, I got a call from the account health team followed by the email below. Basically over the phone, the person told me that there have been multiple orders from buyer accounts which have been linked to my seller account. He also said that it would be in my best interest to acknowledge the problem in the poa followed by what i intend to do immediately and over the long term.
Im an FBM seller and had to stop selling due to my suppliers shutting down because of covid. In March, some of my suppliers got back to work. I wanted to start selling but I was scared that even if there was 1 negative review from a customer, my seller account would breach the 1% ODR and i would be in trouble. Therefore, I used 2 buyer accounts and made some orders and left positive seller feedback. Obviously, this was not a wise thing to do! Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.

1327,Listing Policy Violation - misused asin variations?,"Hello. Amazon sent me this message in early May. I dont know what it means.

1328,Please Help > Notification of Restricted Products Removal,"Hi,
Ive gotten a Notification of Restricted Products Removal relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Can someone please help walk me through the steps of getting this resolved with Amazon as soon as possible.
I list and sell Medical Scrubs (clothing, uniform apparel) and it appears these are being linked to Personal Safety and Household products, such as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and related products as per the notice email I received. The notice email I received listed multiple scrubs ASINs I sell, but my account Product Policy Compliance dashboard only shows Product Policy Violations: 1 for a single parent ASIN.
Ive closed all of my listings to be on the safe side, each is in Inactive (Closed) state. Ive reached out to Seller Support to see what the restriction is as medical scrubs are not a restricted product. Seller Support simply replied saying I understand you have query regarding the ASINs reinstatement. I have confirmed that this product is prohibited on Amazon..
The only thing I can think of doing is going through all my listings to remove medical, surgical and protection as a safeguard as I think these may be buzzwords causing the issue. Or does it makes sense to delete and close all of my listings then relist them from a clean state with these terms removed? Im an FBA seller. Is this something I should do? What else is recommended?
Please advise what I can do to get things live again. Notice and Seller Support reply below.
Subject: Notification of Restricted Products Removal
Hello from Amazon,

1329,Competitor seller hijacked/stole a generic listing because theyre brand registered and Im not,"Hello,
My account has been suspended. Just looking for advice on this. Im sure its happened before to other sellers.
Context:
Ive been selling on Amazon for a number of years now. Im mainly in the automotive/powersports category. Many of the listings I originally joined were unbranded/generic, with no trademark restrictions, or brand names in the title. This is because Amazon said to join existing listings, not create another one, if you were selling essentially the same item.
A few years ago, some sellers (including the one Im currently dealing with) got many of these generic listing titles changed to include their brand name in the front. They also changed the brand name to their own.Then they proceeded to message me on the buyer-seller messaging platform, telling me the ASIN was now theirs, and basically threatened to report me and get my account suspended if I dont back off from selling on it. I believe this abuse of the messaging platform doesnt comply with Amazons policies, but correct me if Im wrong on this.
Back then, I chatted with the listing/catalog team numerous times and sometimes got the affected ASINs changed back to the original generic state. I reported them through the appropriate channels numerous times, and the Amazon reps often said they would take care of it, but these sellers always came back and re-added their names. Recently, theyve moved on to test buying products from me, claiming theyre inauthentic, and reporting me for copyright infringement. Im not the only seller affected. One of the listings they took me down for, had around 10 other sellers on it. They all disappeared too(I assume blocked with copyright infringements like mine) and the listing now says currently unavailable. They finally got my account deactivated yesterday after one too many copyright reports.
Today, I called Seller Support and they basically told me this behavior is allowed because these sellers have brand registry on Amazon, and I dont. I brought up the fact that the stolen listings were created in the 2012-2014 years, yet the trademarks for these hijacking sellers were only registered since 2018 and 2019. They said this doesnt concern Amazon and that generic listings are a high risk category in general, especially for a crowded market in Automotive/Powersports. And that as a seller, I run the risk of this happening if I sell generic things.
So, while I cant believe Amazon condones this kind of abuse, Im moving on and seeking advice for my plan of action to get my account reinstated. Im planning to acknowledge that while my account was closed for too many copyright infringements, I did nothing malicious or broke any rules to get my account deactivated. I just happen to be an unfortunate victim of unjust, but not prohibited, selling behavior. To prevent this from happening in the future, Ive already submitted my own trademark for Brand Registry (I simply didnt have the time to do so before, and wasnt aware of the weight it held on Amazon in controlling listing detail pages). I also plan to create my own branded listings from now on, instead of joining generic ones and running the risk that got me into this whole mess.
Is there anything else I should say? Any help is appreciated. Thanks for reading my lengthy post.",Account Health

WE KNOW THAT AMAZON TAKES INTELLECTUAL PROPERYTY VIOLATIONS VERY SERIOUSLY , and WE ARE TOTALLY AGREE with that and we have tried to do everything in our power to resolve it, but we were unable to get the alibaba supplier to send us the requested information to prove that the product do no infringe any intellectual properity rights.
WE DO NOT WANT TO LIST THE PRODUCT AGAIN , WE URGENTLY NEED TO GET THAT AMAZON AUTHORIZE US TO REMOVE 100% OF STOCK OF AMAZON FBA TO CLAIM AND MANAGE ITS RETURN TO THE SUPPLIER , TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT:
 we send FOUR MAILS to the owners of the patent indicated in it by Amazon apologizing and explaining in detail what happened with article TRADE MARK xxxxx , and unfortunately WE HAD NOT ANY RESPONSE
 We HAVE NOT SOLD A SINGLE PRODUCT
 We HAVE CANCELED THE LISTING (We attach the confirmation email sent by amazon services)
 We have decided NOT TO TRY TO REACTIVE THE LISTING
In light of everything expressed above we reiterate our apologies to AMAZON but we cant finish solving the case. Taking into account that IT WAS OUR FIRST PURCHASE AND ALSO OUR FIRST MISTAKE , we request that someone PLEASE HELP US TO WITHDRAW THE PRUDUCT from FBA to finish solving the problem, close the case and be able to send the new purchase orders that we have already close in China to be sent to FBA.

1334,Account Deactivated,"Hi guys,
After being furloughed from my job, I moved back home with my family and decided to give amazon a try. I signed up for an amazon fba course that costed $3.5k, then signed up for my amazon account. Then I encountered my first problem of identity verification that revealed more problems than I initially thought.
I first opened my account in February and after many appeals, it seems to me my account was somehow related to my dads account (who used to sell old books for my sister back in early 2010s, Im not sure what really happened to his account since I was away for college in another city). I am guessing this was the cause but unfortunately amazon would not provide me any guidance on how to fix my account. I sent all my bills and ID forms in. As last resort, I recently hired egrowth partner $2000 for an appeal form that I wish I had not.
It really sucks. Im already 5.5k in the hole just trying to clear my account. Everything is so sickening to me. Please excuse me as I am writing this with a heavy heart, I cant get anything done right at all. I turned to amazon with the best intent on providing best quality private label products and customer service. I have done so for my 7 year track record of A+ on BBB, in tutoring services manager. But somehow the sins of my father is preventing me from going forward in this scenario. Which is really unfair. What have I done? I moved back home to the same address he used when his account was made yet Im being punished for it? Has anyone had this happen to them? I dont know if the problem is really my dads account that is preventing my account from being verified. After this incident, Amazon has really turned me against using its services in the future. Any info and guidance would be much appreciated.

I thought it was a matter of listing the title Mask and listing it in the Health & Household category. I thought that lists of products that are not medical or coronavirus-related should be listed as title of face covers and listed not Health & Household category.
I listed as a face cover and listing it in the Cloth item category and it violated Amazon policy.
And,
I insisted on unauthorized medical marketing for virus, bacteria or flu in the product description.
I did not know that ""Products that make medical marketing claims may not be legally marketed in the U.S. without prior review and approval by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA). Amazon policy prohibits the listing or sale of products that are marketed as unapproved or unregistered medical devices.
I didnt follow Amazons policy, and I didnt know in advance the information for listing products on Amazon.
The product was listed with the wrong category and keyword, and the wrong product details caused confusion for Amazon customers.
This has deactivated my account.
Corrective measures:
I deleted listing Restricted Product Policy Violations.
There are no other products in the inventory that can no longer violate Amazon policy.
I read review of my listing practices and Amazon polices to identify a potential gap. I understanded and checked Restricted products, Listing Restrictions That Require Statements or Disclosures of Amazon policy.
Preventative measures:
I made the mistake of listing the wrong category product with wrong product description.
In the future, we will follow Amazons recommendations and follow Amazons policy for my listing. I promise to check the three below and list them on Amazon before listing the product in the future.
one. Before listing on Amazon, I will verify that the manufacturer of the product is Amazons trusted manufacturer.
two. Ill check Amazons policy for the category of products Im trying to sell to Amazon.
In particular, Ill check Restricted products, Listing Restrictions That Require Statements or Disclosures and start listing after understanding Amazon policies.
three. Ill check important Amazon alerts, such as Covid 19, twice a week. If there is a problematic listing, close listing first and contact Amazon to check, and if there is a problem listing, Ill follow Amazons policies and recommendations.
I will control all of this myself. Amazon listings, Amazon policy compliance, and Amazon customer management will all be done myself.

1337,Account deactivated for the past 6 Months,"Hi All,
My account was suspended which I believe was due to my account in EU Marketplace and JP marketplace. Like most beginners, we just selected all the Amazon Marketplace to sell as we didnt expect a suspension just from that.
For the past 6 Months, I managed to lift my suspension for the EU Marketplace as it was only suspended due to incomplete application and proceed to close it off.
However for both US and Japan Marketplace, it was due to related accounts. I understand that US marketplace requires my suspension to be lifted in Japan before I can continue here.
After 6 months, I finally received an email from Japan Marketplace staring that even though I provide all the documents, they are unable to reinstate my account as the Amazon Store Name defers from my Company name in my Country.
I had no idea they had to be the same and assume it could be anything we wanted it to be.
Is there any suggestions on how to proceed further?",Account Health

Copyright Complaint ID: 7009385501
Sincerely, Seller Performance Team [https://www.amazon.com]
Any help on this? I appealed because, you know, stupid, but it appears the publisher recently decided to sell new copies via Amazon and kicked all used copies off the site through copyright infringement claims. Not sure what else to appeal except under First Sale Doctrine. But since I was not attempting to sell a new copy, why is it so easy for me to get kicked off the listing AND receive a policy violation rather than a warning when obviously I wasnt doing anything wrong?

1345,Used sold as New 3 items in 3 day period,"All,
I have been selling on Amazon for quite sometime and have not run into any issue like this before. I have an account manager who is telling me one thing and account health telling me something else. Here is what is going on:
I own a brand it is trademarked and on file with the USPTO and registered in Amazon Brand Registry 2.0 etc.
We manufacturer concrete products and have been on Amazon for about 2 years with 10,000+ sold and never a used like new complaint.
The particular products that were removed at different times were all parts of a decorative coating process. 1 is a colorant, 1 is a cleaner, 1 is a topcoat/sealer. The PQ removal states it was Used sold as New. There were no other details. I called account health they found some back end notes that said swatch color not consistent. He explained it all stemmed from the customer not liking the color he was not even sure why it was Used sold as New. The customer did not leave feedback, message us or anything. I could see how after multiple complaints it might flag something but was told it was 1 order and because of color dissatisfaction as a seller I could address this if warned. However the colorant was removed, then over the next two days 2 of my most popular items were as well that were on the order. All with good feedback etc. we have good rankings, metrics, performance until now.
So in closing I need approval to list my own manufactured item that is registered to my brand even with Amazon. Both account health and my account manager said to file a POA as if there was damage and an issue with the packaging being used and add QC measure etc. I get it. However what happened to honesty and actually addressing the issue which sounds like a customer did not like the product. It happens there is feedback, a-z claims, seller feedback and so many other avenues one would think before this happens.
Any thoughts on how to proceed?",Account Health
1346,Deactivated Account for Restricted Products  Is this POA Ready,"Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team,
Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to appeal my seller accounts suspension for listing restricted products that are prohibited from sale on Amazon.
What went wrong / The Root Cause:
 In fact, I did unknowingly list a restricted product. I believe the error occurred in the information I provided when the listing was completed. Furthermore, Ive come to learn that Targus maybe a product that requires additional authorization to sell on your site
 Unfortunately, I am unable to specifically pinpoint where my error occurred. It was my intention to sell a stylus, which I do not believe is a restricted product, I can only surmise that the error occurred in the listing information that I supplied.
 I believe it was in the information i provided in the listing, because I was deactivated for the suspicion trying to sell a red laser pointer. In reality, I was only trying to sell a simple stylus.
 Please note, I was given 48 hours to remove the restricted products. However, at the time, I was given that opportunity I never realized it. Upon my original account deactivation a few years back, I I was in the hospital and unable to respond.
 At the end of last year, I decided to give selling another shot, I looked into my seller account, and I noticed the
newest performance notifications. After researching the Amazon Seller forums on restricted products, and how
to do plans of appeal, I prepared an appeal to state my case.
What I have done to fix the issue.
 I have carefully reviewed all of Amazons guidelines. Furthermore, to prevent any such violations from occurring in the future, Ive researched information regarding the sale of restricted products, the correct way to aadvertise my products.
 Ive educated myself about the products that are prohibited from sale and cant be listed. This includes your Restricted Products policy, including the Examples of Prohibited Listings section. Though its important to point out Ive never missed it a prohibited item, I have educated myself on what those items are to prevent any problems in the future.
 The final step Ive taken is to remove all of the listings that were in doubt, and being questioned. In the future, I will double check all of my listings to make sure that the products are described accurately, and are fully compliant with the rules that Amazon has set forth.
What I will do to prevent this from happening again:
 i believe the error occurred in the listing. In the future to prevent this from happening, if theres anything that Im not absolutely certain about I will call you guys for a clear explanation.
 Ive educated myself about the products that are prohibited from sale, and cant be listed. This includes your Restricted Products policy, including the Examples of Prohibited Listings section. Though its important to point out Ive never missed it a prohibited item, I have educated myself on what those items are to prevent any problems in the future.
 Before listing any new items on Amazon, I will verify that they are permitted for sale, and compliant with Amazon policies and procedures.
 To help ensure that I do not violate any more policies, I will also research whether all of my products are accurately described, and correctly listed in the most informative way for any potential buyers.
 Weekly Reviews of:
Amazon Policies
Seller Central Updates
Amazon Seller Support Forums
Federal, State, and Local Laws/Regulations
Product Updates and Recalls
These reviews will ensure I maintain strict adherence to all of the above.
 New Listing Method:
The 3 Rs - Reasearch, Reveal, Review , then Post
Research
This step ensures I dont encounter this dilemma again, it will include me ,
Checking into your policies
All Laws and Regulations
Product Updates and Recalls
Reveal
This step is to simply list the item that I'm trying to sell.  I called reveal because here is where I reveal                 
everything about the product, such as photos, condition,  description etc.

Review
The final step is to review what I am trying to list for sale. At this point, I will review all of my research,
what I am trying to reveal, and Ill take this opportunity to give my listing one final look over.
Post 
Then, my product will be ready to be successfully listed!
 My weekly reviews, and new listing method should be my safeguard to fix my root cause I the future!

 These corrective  actions will ensure I can immediately take action, and proactively remain compliant with my     
   listings.  Any products that I am unable to verify with 100% certainty, will not be listed.
In conclusion , I believe that this plan provides that this issue has been rectified, and itll be prevented from occurring again. I look forward to having my selling privileges restored. I also look forward to hearing from you! Thanks again for your time!
SIncerely,

They said they wanted a detailed plan even though there is no way we couldve prevented this from happening. Any suggestions on a plan we can use that will help us out?

This was very confusing for me, but I felt that I knew what happened. I have a Shopify store under the same business name and I was trying to set up Amazon payments for customers to use for their checkout. Shopify prompted me to set up an Amazon Merchant account and as I was setting it up, I realized that the merchant account set up was just a registration form for a new Amazon seller account. By the time that I realized this, I was already on page 2 of the Amazon merchant registration. I had put in all of my business information along with an email address associated with my Shopify store. The email address that I entered was different than the email address that I used in my current, active Amazon seller account. There was no way for me to delete the new seller account registration so I exited the page. I believe this is what prompted Amazon to send me the notification message above.
So I after sending in multiple appeals to Amazon to explain the error and that I really only had one seller account, they just sent me automated replies that my account was still deactivated. I then proceeded to call Amazon seller support to address the issue and they told me that there was nothing they could to help me and that I just needed to keep emailing Seller Performance. Its really messed up and horrible how Amazon has no phone number for the seller performance team and they purposely make it so that that the seller support team and seller performance team have no means of communication.
One seller support representative was finally able to confirm that I had an Amazon customer service account with my business information under that email address that I used in the second merchant registration. I never created this. So Im guessing that if you dont complete the Amazon merchant registration, it automatically creates it into a customer service account. Seller support said that I didnt have any other seller accounts in their system besides the only active one that I had already been selling on. So I had the customer service account deleted by Amazon.
After numerous emails and appeals to multiple departments to the seller performance team to explain this, with documentation, I have received no responses. If I submit messages in the Get help department my message gets marked as answered and I dont get a response.
I had heard the horror stories about selling on the Amazons seller platform, but this really takes the cake for me. I had no reason to be seen as fraudulent on Amazons platform. As a small business owner who sold only 3 units, I was shocked that I would be treated this way. I decided to create a removal order for my inventory and move on.

1365,Help new account creation Russian,"Hi,
I am a long time seller and my girlfriend decided to open an account, but did not prepare the documentation she would need beforehand. So now I want to make sure we can get everything right. She opened a personal account, the one you dont pay 40 dollars per month, instead of the professional account.
I have an account and I know it is not necessary anymore to tell seller performance that someone in the same household has an account, but I was thinking to send them an email after it was created, or could it help to send now?
Her IP address is the same as mine right now, in Spain, which could be a problem but I read using a VPN would be worst.
She has a utility bill, but of course is in Russian, which she should have an official translator to translate and notarize.
She has only debit cards, she will ask her bank for a credit card, I read one post that said debit cards and prepaid cards dont work, is that correct?
She is a Sole proprietor in Russia, and she will look for documentation now that can accredit that.
Seller performance email does not put any deadline for her to do all this, but I assume 30 days is the standard?

1367,"Accounts in multiple countries, then suspension","A ton of forum discussions on related account suspension, but dont see material related to my issue.
I am new to Amazon seller central, had my account for about 2 weeks and havent even submitted a product to start selling yet. One afternoon, without my selecting the option, I got emails that I was charged in Amazon Japan and Amazon Europe to sell in those locations, and an hour later, my account was suspended due to related accounts.
Without doing any research in forums/online, I interpreted it as Amazon suspending my account because I originally tried to make a sellers account under a different work email address. I was having issues with the onboarding process (uploaded wrong documents under wrong category). Long story short, I never completed that process, so that account is not complete and inactive. I also thought they suspended account because I accessed my account from another laptop, which is under VPN since thats a work laptop.
I found Danny_Amazons post and started following his suggested steps to appeal in all regions except my main region (North America). Amazon Europe needed some more documents for verification (i.e. utility bills), so I uploaded that. Then, I submitted an appeal in Japan, following the format recommended in other forums Ive seen. The reasons I gave as my fault are (1) the first account I tried to make that is not incomplete, and (2) accessing an account from the work laptop.
But, as I read all these forums, Im not even sure thats what caused the issue, but I still stated them as my fault. I also did not sign up for Amazon Global and I did not activate the other regions. So Im not sure why I even have accounts there now.
Its been 5 days and I have not heard back from Amazon Japan. It will take Amazon Europe 1-2 days to approve my additional documents. Once those are approved, Ill send the same appeal. In those appeal letters, Ive also requested that those respective accounts get deleted.
Ive looked into 3rd party lawyers to help, but hearing mixed reviews, so unsure if I should go down that avenue.
Any suggestions on what to do? Do I just wait, or are there any more steps I should take? Since I havent heard back in 5 days, does that mean I probably wont hear back at all?
Appreciate the help and insight.",Account Health

1371,Why The Product Condition Complaint Appeal Process Needs to Change - Detailed Analysis Including Examples of Nonexistent Used as New Complaints Triggering Deactivations,"This is the third time in 6 months where we had a listing deactivated for a used product sold as new complaint in which a customer did not even submit an item condition complaint at all. Im paraphrasing a tad but heres the gist:
6 months ago - These are the wrong color for my vehicle. We sent what was advertised and the customer sent pictures of them brand new sealed in the package with no damage (they are floor mats), their only complaint was that they didnt match the interior - and the color was very close, they just ordered the wrong shade. We helped them with a return and a refund only get the dreaded performance notification claiming that we sold a used product when of course, we did not. The customer never indicated in any way that there was a condition issue of any kind, just a color match issue.
1 month ago - Please cancel this order, my old one can be repaired and this product wont need to be used. -The buyer worded their cancellation request in a strange manner like that and it tripped up Amazons police bots. We cancelled the order per the customers request and then the listing was deactivated for used as new when we didnt even send anythingyet another several hour process to appeal it. This was our only sale on the product in months so we know it was this order.
This week - This fits classic 2019 GMC Sierra not new body style 2019 GMC sierra. This is a car part that was properly advertised, but thats a side point - it seems Amazons bots were once again triggered because of not new being written within that return comment, in that order, even though it had nothing to do with the product. The buyer didnt even open the transparent bag - its still sealed in perfect condition. This is one of our top sellers and gathering the invoices alone for this will take hours and Im sure crafting a POA for a nonexistent condition complaint will be a walk in the park!
Im not here just to vent - Im sure a lot of you have experienced totally ridiculous product condition complaints too, which seem to be increasing in frequency and lack of validity. Im here because Im hoping, without holding my breath, that Amazon reads these forums and that meaningful change might come of feedback like this. I get that product quality is a huge issue for Amazon as a platform and we agree. Our reputation and repeat business are very important to us, and we have never, and would never sell used products. However, we are constantly getting snagged by a seemingly well-intentioned policy that is atrociously executed. Not only do these complaints put us in fear of an unjustified account deactivation which would put us out of business, but they are incredibly time consuming and difficult to win, and it takes time away from us that we should be using to provide quality customer service to our customers. Ill list a few reasons why the process absolutely needs to change:
1.) These complaints clearly are not being reviewed by a human before the hammer drops on sellers like us - software generates them and whether valid or not, you are forced to go through the motions even if Amazon later confirms there was no real condition related complaint, as account health support did for us in all of these situations. If the complaints ARE being reviewed before deactivation occurs, the review team is grossly incompetent. Reviewing these before taking action would SAVE Amazon money as it would take a lot less time to confirm if a complaint is valid than the time it takes for them to pay an individual to review a POA an invoices once deactivation has occurred.
2.) There is no way for us to communicate with the review team, and neither can Account Health Support. If a POA is denied, they NEVER give a reason why. Its ALWAYS the exact same cookie cutter denial letterwe need greater this, greater that, etc. There is only one denial message whether the problem was root cause, immediate steps, or preventative steps, or the invoices. Same message, no notes, no feedback. Youre in the dark.
3.) The quality/skill/competency of the reviewing individual is wildly inconsistent. I used to email our appeals in from my main, registered email that I log in with, and I always included our seller name, market (US, Amazon.com), the ASIN, applicable order numbers, etc. I was once told that I dont even have a seller account and thats why they cant review my condition complaint appeal! Ive also submitted MANY appeals that were denied and upon contacting Account Health Support they say we have no idea why this is denied, you were extremely thorough, everything is here, you even made a YouTube video showing your new packing methods, etc. Just resubmit the same thing. - Ive been told that probably on five occasions. There is a glaring human error/opinion component in the review process.
4.) Some of our appeals have not been responded to even though Ive sent them in multiple timesnot even a denial notification, just radio silence. Im not just being impatient; this was months ago.
Im sure there are more reasons to add, please feel free to chime in with agreement, or disagreement, and why - I welcome the feedback of other sellers. I firmly believe that its an injustice to sellers who spend an incredible amount of money, sweat, and tears building a business only to have a constant fear that a few product condition complaints could put pull the rug out from under you in an instant and destroy your livelihood. If the complaints were valid, wed be in great shape. However, 60% of the complaints we get are due to shipping damage which CANNOT be prevented in all cases. We spend a huge amount on packing supplies and package our products very well. UPS is going to do what UPS does and sometimes no amount of bubbles, stuffing paper, box braces, double boxes, etc, can save a product from being mishandled, especially on some of our larger, heavier items. The other 40% of our complaints seem to be completely false complaints that have nothing to do with product condition, like the examples above, or in some cases buyers dont know what to expect because they are not mechanics (some auto parts come pre-oiled from the manufacturing plant, etc). We supplement descriptions to indicate this when we can though we have tens of thousands of listings and thats not an overnight process. Even if the information is on the listing, we still sometimes get complaints because the customer didnt read the ad, or they wanted free return shipping so they complained, etc. Weve also had a few situations where we sent out a new, sealed product that weve never had a return on only to be returned the customers OLD auto part and then they buckle down to get a full refund. Im talking about parts with YEARS of road debris, dirt, sun fading, shattered old mirrors with an internal design that was already phased out, etc. Of course, these scammers never want a replacement since they already kept the good part and dont need another. They always want refunds and even if I have evidence to prove we werent returned what we sold, we have to pretend we did something wrong and explain how well fix it once the inevitable listing deactivation occurs.
In closing, a click of the mouse from an individual on a team that you cannot communicate with can put you out of business. One click of the mouse From our experience, this team cannot even reliably confirm you have a seller account in all cases. The complaints you are appealing are provably nonexistent in some cases and are usually shipping damage in most other cases. In cases where Amazon confirms there is no complaint, there is no loophole or alternative to the process. As I assume most of you will agree, this process is broken and while I believe there SHOULD be a process to ensure sellers are not cheating Amazon customers, the execution could not be worse. Please chime in with your comments, thank you!",Account Health

This is not the EXACT action plan I submitted which was rejected. I revised it a bit, added some more detail, and then submitted the action plan below, but I am still awaiting response. I would like to hear from some experienced users, on how I could improve my plan.
MY PLAN:
Dear Amazon Team,
We are writing to appeal the decision to suspend our account, and have our account reinstated. We already submitted our appeal, but we were asked to go into greater detail. I hope the following will satisfy the appeal critera:
ASINs in question: B06XXDB7DG, B06XXGYNBM, B082LSL47T, B07T1HJN1N, B07T5RLLSM, B082DD6CZV, B07PQVXPY8, B082FTT785, B07CVSZ58G, B07T2HQ32C

ROOT CAUSES OF INFRINGEMENT:
The root cause of the infringement issue, was due to incorrectly listed products. We are a small company and all our employees were not 100% familiar with the terms and policies of Amazon.com. Below are the root causes as to why we ran into some Intellectual Property complaints:
We INCORRECTLY listed some of our items by using the Sell Yours button in order to list our products, without fist ensuring that the product in question, isnt a protected brand, design, or name. The root cause of this problem, was incorrect and incomplete understanding of the Intellectual Property Rights Policies.
Proper attention was not paid to the product detail page, and/or the branded name attached to the product. Although the product in the listing photos looked like our product, they are not 100% the same product, which resulted in complaints by the original seller of that ASIN.
We listed unbranded product and simply added it other sellers product detail pages including those ASINs listed above. Although our product is similar, it is not purchased from, nor manufactured from the same company as the product listing page, and therefore do NOT not have permission to be sold under their brand.
We understand that in order to sell items under the aforementioned ASINs, we must first seek permission from the intellectual property rights owner, and then receive proof of permission.
Another root cause, is that we didnt do our due diligence in researching the manufacturer of said products, and whether they are violating any trademarks and/or other intellectual property rights.
ACTIONS TAKEN TO RESOLVE INFRINGEMENT ISSUES:
Below are is a list of all the actions weve taken to correct this issue, in order to be re-instated and avoid this issue in the future:
ALL items listed under product pages which were created by other sellers, have been taken down.
ALL listings, including ASINs not listed above, have been taken down for re-evaluation and correction.
We have ceased ALL business transactions with manufacturers whom are unable to provide certificates of authenticity and/or property rights
In order to resolve these issues, the owner(s) to the rights to sell the products associated with the above mentioned ASINs have been e-mailed and apologized to. We have also asked that they dislodge their complaint against us.
We have gone through our entire inventory of items, and carefully evaluated which items can be listed and which should not be listed, in order to be in compliance with not only Intellectual Property policies, but ALL Amazon seller policies.
We will cease to sell ANY unbranded product, without first investigating whether it is under protection or not.
PREVENTION:
To avoid infringement on intellectual property and listing counterfeit products on Amazon, the following measures will be implemented to our sellers account:
We will create our own product listing for our unbranded items, with its own ASIN, under our own acquired brand, and will never use another sellers product detail page, so that we can avoid customer confusion and infringement complaints.
If we are selling a similar or identical product to other existing listing, we will follow Amazon policy and list under the existing ASIN, but ONLY after we have investigated the brand and property rights. Only once we have determined that our addition to the existing listing will NOT be in violation of the infringement policy will we list the item.
We now understand the seriousness of this matter, and have created a new bookkeeping system to keep records of purchase orders, invoices, receipts, and other documentation, in order to prove legal purchase and authenticity of goods in the future.
Staff will be trained to create product listings, using new listings or using pre-existing product details pages that comply with Amazon intellectual Property policy . A senior and experienced staff member to double check for any product detail pages for possible intellectual property violations before listing any products on the platform.
Please note that we have ceased ALL operations with the manufacturers in question.
In order to prevent this from ever happening again, we are going to be proactive and make sure we have all documentation, permits, certifications of authenticity, and other relevant paperwork, before listing on Amazon.com.
We have invested a great deal of effort and time to establish our company as a reputable seller on Amazon. We take pride in our quick deliveries and I hope to continue being a part of the Marketplace. These problems have become a wakeup call and we will now be much more diligent in our policies regarding items we list on Amazon.
Our experience has been very positive and we hope that you will trust us to do better once re-instated.

1378,Account Suspension help,"Hello everyone,
My account has been suspended in march for price gouging and I have written 4 appeals and still no luck. Would anyone give me some feedback on my appeal. Thank you in advance
I was initially deactivated for price gouging for the three following ASINS: xxx. I was selling xxx on amazon because the demand went up and the market place was supporting and dictating higher prices; I was not selling the products higher than other marketplace sellers selling the products. The root cause of the error is that the market was dictating prices but none of us caught up to the gravity of the seriousness of the pandemic until an emergency was declared. With the benefit of hindsight, participating in the marketplace was an error because these products were being sold at inflated prices because of the pandemic. I realized that under the current circumstances it is wrong to participate in an inflated market caused by a pandemic. As soon as the seriousness of the situation was understood and a national emergency declared I have taken down all items considered essential. Due to the pandemic, the market place for these items were inflated through all suppliers. . The Marketplace had demand and I provided the supply and cheaper than sellers as well. I have processed all remaining orders which was received up until being temporarily deactivated to avoid any other issues. I deleted the listings from my inventory that were flagged as being considered essential. I also made sure to remove all other listings which could not be verified with valid invoices or receipts required by Amazon. I have and will continue to monitor any customer emails, returns or complaints that may arise after the deactivation. I have carefully read all the amazon policies, especially the ones concerning the proper ways to source inventory and amazons fair market pricing policy. I have also done deeper research to ensure that I fully understand Amazons policies, so that I will not violate them again. For the future we do not intend to use the amazon marketplace as benchmark but also compare to prices offline. We understand that we may not charge more than MSRP. We are not trying to take advantage of any human crisis. We would like to participate in the amazon marketplace, and we will be on the lookout for any competitive items where the prices seem to be inflated. I have set my criteria which includes minimum and maximum order quantities, specific methods of delivery and quality assurance processes. I will approach selected companies directly for proposals and estimates for example Pet Stages which I have first on my suppliers list. I will monitor the selected suppliers performances to guarantee quality and to ensure that they can continuously support my business requirements by delivering the appropriate goods on time. I will seek permission from the brand owners to be able to resell their products on Amazon, and at a FAIR price. before listing any items for sale, I will carefully check, whether they perfectly match their Amazon product pages in every detail. Any inaccuracies will be resolved by updating the listing and fixing the incorrect information. I will continue to audit and monitor my inventory daily and will continue to store my products in my storage facility which has label bins with a structure order and an inventory movement system. I will make sure to completely understand and stay up to date with all amazons policies and guidelines.
Below you will find the ASINs that got my account temporarily deactivated.

1379,What type of documents/invoice/proof would Amazon require if you are selling a private label that you manufacture yourself?,"I hope that everyone here is staying safe and healthy.
I need some advice:
In the past we had an Item Condition policy violation that was unfairly brought upon us and which we were unable to resolve. We bought the product directly from the US manufacturer and sold it. There was no reason that we had been in violation of anything but here we are waiting for the violation to fall off in a couple of weeks. We never had any performance metrics issues but that.
Now, I have a question and need help from very helpful experts here. I need some hands on experience on this topic, and so please offer me some good advice.
We have developed our own product and will be putting it up on Amazon for sale soon. Before we do that, I would like to see what is the road ahead. If ever for some reason we encounter an Item Condition violation or something like it again (we certainly hope not), how do we defend ourselves? Because we manufacture the product, the invoices will be for the materials that we use to make the product, right? So, what invoices would Amazon ask for? If they would require invoices of our raw materials, would that not man that Amazon will also have to understand how you produce your product in order to understand how many of such raw materials you should have purchased to make sure that you actually had enough to produce all that you had sold? You get where I am coming from, right?
When we were trying to resolve our violation, we provided invoices of everything we sold, which showed that we had stocked more than what we sold, We provided the contact information for our one and only supplier whose name was stated in the invoice. We provided everything else that we were asked for. Amazon did not approve any of our appeals. I do not think that they were really reading AND understanding all of what we provided, which were all straightforward.
Therefore, I am wondering how anyone had dealt with an Item Condition violation if they ever encountered it on a product that they are manufacturing and private labeled. How does Amazon treat a manufacturer? Experts, I would appreciate your response.",Account Health

Now I am locked out of 2 of my products because one of the unscrupulous sellers have filed false copyright infringement claims against ME for my OWN PRODUCTS. Its really surreal and hard to believe this is happening.
I have replied to: ""notice-dispute@amazon.com"" with my defense and credentials for each claim links to my business site that have these products, etc but they have not taken any action as of yet. But the false claims sure seem to work right away for the criminal since I get locked out immediately.
I have since registered my brand with USPTO but we all know how long that takes. And I get it, hindsight I should have registered before.
How does this work going forward, can just anyone with a burner email address make a false infringement claim on amazon and straight up steal another sellers product and lock them out at will anytime they want?
Please advise or help @Cecilia_Amazon, @Cassie_Amazon, @Katie_Amazon.
Thanks in advance.

1381,First bad feedback. Any Advice?,"Well it was bound to happen eventually. After about 4 years I received negative seller feedback. Im not so much looking for yall to hold my hand and tell me Im pretty. I just want to know from the pros if theres anything I can do to remove the review. I sell Handmade (FBM) only and I do a fraction of the sales that most of yall do. In a nutshell
Buyer purchased 6 small decorative balls. In her order she specified that she wanted 2 small green, 2 medium blue and 2 large red. To be clear, the product name is small decorative balls - not medium, not large. Those are listed elsewhere and cost more. Theres really nothing confusing about the listing - not sure how she interpreted it like that. So anyway I send her a message through Amazon a few days before the order was due to ship, explaining the situation and asking how shed like to proceed. No reply. So on the ship date, I cancelled the order instead of sending her the 6 small balls that she paid for because I figured shed claim sent wrong item or whatever and Id lose money on both original and return shipping. First and only time Ive ever cancelled an order.
So I just received this lovely one-star rating: My order was cancelled with no contact or reason??? I dont see refund yet. I will add more negative comments if I dont see a refund this week. Would have been nice if company advised cancellation on their end.!!!
I replied with this: Good afternoon. You purchased 6 small balls but requested large and medium in your order. I messaged you on 4/25 to confirm with you that all 6 balls will be the same size, but you did not reply, so I cancelled the order because I could not complete it without more information. Upon cancelling the order, you should have been automatically refunded by Amazon.
So, any advice? I dont think I have grounds to request removal because she wasnt obscene, its not FBA, etc And I know its just one review, but the thing is I only have 22 reviews total. So this one review cost me about 5% of my rating. And I cant say Im thrilled about being accused of not communicating (cuz I did) and I also dont love the insinuation that I stole her money - I never confirmed the order so her money never transferred to my account. Apparently I can send her some pre-written message composed by Amazon? But its lame and I dont see the point. What do yall think? Put on my big boy pants and move on with life? That aint easy for a Scorpio. Thanks!!!",Account Health

1383,Help! Account Suspended- Covid19 situtation,"Hello everyone,
I will try to give as much as details as I can so you can give me your best advice on what should I do. Ive been racking my brain the last couple of days to solve this issue.
End of March, through invitation, I am in contact with an Amazon Covid19 Business Prep, after reviewing all my docs and information, she advised me to open a new professional business account as our products are eligible for covid19 priority.
(Keep in mind, to sell in the Covid 19 section, all the invoice, import and license have to be verified and match)
April 12th, Following her advice, I open the brand new account with Amazon on April 15 but did not list anything because we are in process of being verified by Amazons legal department.
April 14th, I received an email from Amazon to verify our name, which I did right away by sending my drivers license.
April 21st, while waiting for Amazon legal to process my application, I tried to be more familiar with Seller Central and created a cloth mask listing with no inventory and got an instant notification of restricted product listing. I followed the instruction notification and closed the listing.
April 30, we receive a notification stating that our amazon.com selling privileges have been removed:
Hello,
We found that your account is related to an account that may not be used to sell on our site. As a result, you may no longer sell on Amazon.com.
We removed your listings from our site. Funds will not be transferred to you but will be held in your account while we work with you to address this issue. Please ship any open orders to avoid further impact to your account.
You can see your balance and settlement information in the Payments section of Seller Central. If you have questions about those, please write to payments-funds@amazon.com.
If you want to appeal this decision, click the Appeal button next to this email on the Performance Notifications page in Seller Central.
May 1st, In my mind, I thought the reason was related to the restricted products violation on April 12th. I appeal that I am new and will be careful next time and currently working with an Amazon rep to get our products whitelisted.
I not get any response from my appeal.
May 4th my Amazon business rep confirm my application is final and eligible to list on Covid19 stores and urge me to list.
May 8th I found out about Amazons Account Health and tried to resubmit the same information as the appeal there (sorry I am newI only knew about the appeal and was waiting in the hopes that I will get a response from someone within 1-2 business days)
May 8th I receive a response email from Amazon Japan

May 10th I appeal providing both of my accounts, as I dont have any other than my personal account from Amazon which I used to buy often and the seller from that account I used to sell used books when I was in college not active 10+ years already. I am President and shareowner of the corporation with different selling account.
The same day, I got the response from Amazon saying:
_our Amazon seller account has been deactivated. Your listings have been removed. Funds will not be transferred to you but will be held in your account while we work with you to address this issue. Please ship any open orders to avoid further impact to your account.
_Why is this happening? _
Your Amazon seller account has been deactivated in accordance with section 3 of Amazons Business Solutions Agreement. This decision was made after reviewing both your account and the information provided.
What did I do wrong and how can I fix it? Why Amazon Japan answer me? Why I got no response with my appeal? and why my account flagged since I did not sell anything yet.
The Amazon Covid 19 agent is asking for an update every day since we were approved and my products are in need. When she took a look at her limited system, she sees that my account is flagged as fraud with a few sellers accounts listed but all linking to one account; other than that she cant figure anything else.
She suggested I put my phone number as the subject line so someone from Customer Service can call me back and tell me what the issue is. I did and Amazon just closed my case without any response.
I am a patriot before a businessman, but I am stuck here, cant figure what can I do now to resolve this issue.
Any people here can help to point me in the right direction?

1384,Mistakingly Identified Restricted Product,"My company is a new seller on Amazon and signed up for a professional sellers account as our newly launched companys only product is a food related product. We are the inventors and manufacturers of our product so we needed to create a new ASIN for it. The process was not easy and took about a week just to get the ASIN.
After about 1 day of our product finally being live on Amazon we became Buy Box eligible. Within 24 hours I noticed our listing was no longer there. I did not receive any emails from Amazon, or any notifications in the account health section. It was simply gone. I reached out to Amazon asking what happened and waited. The first case log was started on May 3rd. I received this response
"" Thank you for your patience. We have reviewed your listing for ASIN B087V74QL7 and have determined that the ASIN will not be reinstated.
This product has been identified as a prohibited hemp product. Hemp products that contain CBD, THC or Resin are prohibited from listing or sale on Amazon""
I have sent multiple emails with proof that our product does not contain any Hemp, CBD, Resin or any ingredients within that realm and it has become apparent that the support team has not even read my emails. They simply keep sending the EXACT same email that I pasted above. I have called multiple times and support has been no help because they can not communicate with that department and can only translate the message. It has been 2 weeks and Amazon has been no help getting this ASIN reinstated. I have sent the same proof and nutritional label 3 times with no avail. At this point we have been paying $40 a month to deal with a headache and 0 support from Amazon.

The invoices and contact info (name, address, tel, cell, email, website) we provided are from suppliers that Amazon had verified and accepted in the past. Also, my suppliers say they have had no contact from Amazon. Ultimately, we decided to contact jeff@ on May 5 (8 days ago) to see if someone in the executive team can look into our case and review the details.

1387,Listing Policy Violation - Brand Name Change,"We recently received listing policy violation from Amazon. Amazon stated that we chIanged the brand name of the listing and canceled the ASIN. The fact is, we didnot create the listing, we simply added ourselves to the existing listing. The listing had a brand name of the famous brand which was changed by other seller to his brand to hijack the listing. When that came to our notice, we reached out to Amazon with all documentary evidences and requested them to change it back to its original brand name. Amazon did change it but the hijacker again changed it back to his brand name. In a month from that incident we received violation notice.
Will appreciate guidance on what should be the action we should take.",Account Health
1388,Suspended for Suspected IP Violations,"We got 15 ASINs marked as Suspected Intellectual Property Violations. To avoid any potential issues, we deleted the listings and decided not to sell them again. Then 10 ASINs disappeared and 5 remained in the dashboard. Now our account has been suspended for the reason that We(Amazon) have not received a valid plan of action addressing the infringement issues below.
 XXXXXX(10 ASINs that disappeared)
We submitted our first appeal several days ago but got rejected. After calling the account support team, they said that there was a note root cause left by performance team and they thought we need to provide greater details on the root cause.
Please give advice on our root cause:
The root of the cause:
The IP compliance checking guide and support we offered to our staff were not in-depth and sufficient. There should be a reliable guide for them to refer to. When theres uncertainty, we should use support from a professional attorney to ensure that all products and listings are compliant with Amazons IP policies.
More details: In November 2019, our operational staff Leila Liu was planning to develop some new products. After analyzing the market demand and similar products, she chose a product(XXXXX) with some color variations. She checked trademarks/copyrights/patents compliance by merely searching a few keywords extracted from the existed product pages and her experience. She used the trademark/copyright/patent database from CIPO and thought the product was compliant. After confirming that the products did not belong to restricted or gated categories, she listed the ASINs mentioned at the top of the mail without recognizing that it might cause potentially IP infringement. However, the ASINs were marked as SUSPECTED later in March. Upon receiving the notice, we did an advanced patent search using more keywords that described product features. We concluded that these products features might potentially infringe a design patent (No.XXXXXX) in the 11th claim XXXXXXXX. During the product development process, it relied on our operational staffs personal experience to check IP compliance. That was unreliable and questionable.",Account Health
1389,No Response to case new account - I dont have utility bills!,"Hello, thank you in advance for reading this.
I just opened my account and I am totally new so please bare with me. It was approved pretty quickly but randomly suspended right after because they wanted a bill for piped or natural gas, electricity, piped water, or internet service. I responded to the case that I pay for none of these here at home. I have other things like my passport, student loan stuff, I mean take your pick. (At this point Ill send them anything.) But, I then get some template email and the rep totally ignored all I said. It was same exact response and they closed the case. I thought, ok, maybe he didnt see what I wrote. I respond and reopen case. I check the next day, closed! I was like what? Ok then I opened a new one now. It has been a couple of days with no answer. It says they typically respond in 12 hours. But nothing.
I cannot possibly be the only person who lives with someone that has the utilities under their name and not themselves Do I just upload a jpg or pdf saying the same thing in the upload section so the right people see it? THey even asked me for a bank statement! (By the way, I had to send this twice because I thought my balance and account number was private information, so i blacked it out the first time. I found that no they want the whole thing - a bit invasive but I immediatelysent the whole pdf and they had approved me the next day). Great, so I am active (yey) but then suspend me just as fast? I dont get it.
Im learning they ask a lot by reading online because of people trying to mess with the system. So, I get it ok, great. But Im a REAL PERSON trying to begin this process. What do I do here? Who do I contact? Is there a more effective way to reach someone?

SOMEHOW tonight I was digging and trying to figure out what could have happened and I remembered that last year I logged on to my Prime account and for some reason my cart was empty after I had just added items from another device. Turns out I had TWO accounts with the same email address but different passwords.
So I used a different password to login and bam there is my original seller account from a couple years ago, still in perfect condition. Use a different password with the same email address and it gives me the closed due to inactivity notice.
I have no idea how or when that other account was created, and if a seller account was also created. How is it even possible to create two accounts with the same email address but different passwords??
So I would LOVE some advice on how to handle this.
Id like to keep my original account and have this newly created account deleted. Ive gone back through all of my emails and I cant find any record of there being an account created that eventually went dormant.

 The root cause(s) of why the product inauthenticity complaints happened.
I apologize and take full responsibility. The Inauthenticity complaints occured because I did not make it clear enough in the products listing what the products were, thus customers got the wrong idea.
 The actions you have taken to resolve product inauthenticity complaints.
I have added a customer service phone number in which the customer can contact me directly to help resolve these complaints.
I have also removed all listings in order to start over and make sure I list them correctly and describe them properly.
 The steps you have taken to prevent product inauthenticity complaintsgoing forward
I have since taken extra steps to assure I state clearly and concisely what each product is that I sell as to not accidentally mislead the customers.
If there is anymore information i must give please let me know.

Suspended for policy violation
The Reason for the violation was due to products that ended up not being Authentic products. I unfortunately had no idea that these items were not Authentic products. I was a very new seller and did not take all the necessary precautions that i should have taken before trying to sell these items.
I would really like to continue to sell on Amazon. I have developed a Plan of Action which I believe will eliminate problems Ive had in the past. Going forward:
I will only list Authentic inventory I have in stock.
I will always ship within 2 business days.
Customer Service is a top priority. I will respond to all messages within 24 hours, 7 days a week.
If a buyer requests a refund, I will Authorize the Return.
If a buyer claims not received, I will immediately issue a full refund.
I will reread the participation agreement to ensure I comply with all of Amazons rules and regulations.
I will do my part to make sure I no longer purchase and sell products unless they are Authentic products.
It has taken me 6 months for me to think about my mistakes and think about how I can make it better. I deeply apologize for violating Amazons policies and would like one last chance to prove that I can and will do better going forward.
I hope this plan of action is sufficient, if it is not then please let me know anything else I can do to make sure that this does not happen again.
I would like the opportunity to again sell on Amazon. I will rigorously conform to all of Amazons policies.
Thank You,
Ryan Cote

1404,Help! Appeal for listing for inauthentic claim. Invoice problem,"Help.
I got a inauthentic complain and Amazon has deactivated my listings asking me to provide invoice for this product. I dont have a invoice that has the Suppliers contact information and their website. Besides my supplier is Chinese and he gave me the Chinese Receipt which does not have their website and address in it. So my question does my receipt or invoice has to be English? If I dont have one, should I ask my supplier to make a English one, with their contact information and website as well?

Title: Dr. Seuss ABC Gator Plush Toy Doll Kohls Cares
Since I no longer had the item for sale in my inventory, I deleted the product and listing from my inventory and thought this was the right course of action.
I received a message on May 12, 2020 that my account was under review and I would be contacted within 24 hours by phone. I answered the call May 13, 2020, and discovered the issue was for these two Received Intellectual Property complaints. I explained that I received the notification for the ABC Gator and upon receiving the notification, I deleted the item from my inventory. However, I was given 72 hours to give a POA, with the root, corrective, and preventive action. I am just not sure how to go about it as I was not intending to relist these items which the appeal button is to reactivate my listing, however, I do need to appeal these within 72 hours nevertheless. I never listed these two items as new as they were just from my collection and I do not have invoices, the listings were not created by me (so I do believe I wasnt the only seller to have received this notification). Since the pages are no longer on Amazon and have since turned to dog pages, I cannot see what and where the violation is. I have since then been going through the forums for advice, however, I have not been successful in finding what I did do wrong in the case of these two and want to be proactive on making sure none of my other listings have this issue. I have seen others note in the POA they have contacted the rights owner, however, I cannot seem to find that, as I am not sure if it was to be in the message (I only received one message). The hardest part is, I cannot figure out what I did wrong, but if I did, I do take ownership of that and do realize I need to take action, I just seem to not be able to figure out where the violation occurs. If anyone can help, with helping me pinpoint where the violation took place (of course, I am still looking), I could definitely then know where and how to plan my corrective and preventive action. I appreciate any help!!",Account Health
1406,Account got deactivated. False Infringe Claims trademarks counterfeit,"I have been selling 8+ years on amazon. I never really had to deal with kind of stuff until now. My account got suspended for the first time and I am freaking out.
We never sold it but the listings were active at 0 qty. I did some research on this matter and found out that now having OLD Inactive or blocked listings can get your account blocked.
The brand right owner is RAZER. It seems that they do not want anyone to resell on amazon and start harassing all the resellers on amazon (fine I wont purchase your products again).
I did not fully understand the suspension appeal process at first and submitted a very sloppy POA.
I used a template online for the 2nd one rejected. I called amazon for some advice and 3rd one but rejected again after 2 days. 4th rejected again. 5th too after removing some complaints.
Currently there in 1 Intellectual Property Complaint (counterfeit claim from RAZER) related to the account deactivation. down from (3). They are all false and baseless claims anyway. But the copyright owners are so slow in handling the claim. I asked 4-5 times and they never reply or do anything. One guy was trolling just to burn some times. I had to ask him that I will take him to the court if he does not cooperate.
Do I deal with this last complaint then ask for reactivation then submit a POA?
Will amazon even look at our POA with the any pending Received Intellectual Property Complaints?
Is it better to deal with those claims individually first then ask for reinstatement afterward?
This whole suspension circus is ridiculous. I lost so much money past 2 weeks and amazon did too.
I am so busy with PPP and other corona related chaos and this deactivation is really stressing me out.

1407,We opened two accounts under the same computer and IP and address,"Hi sellers community.
I have a huge concern regarding Amazon multiple accounts policy.
Long story short, my roommate and I decided to open amazon seller accounts to dive into this business. We did the accounts registrations under the same computer (mine) the same day
The accounts are under review stage (suspended) they asked us bills to prove our address I believe this is standard precedence these days, nothing to do with multiple accounts policy
Later ( a couple of days) we learned that amazon prohibits having multiple accounts. And even though those are two entirely different accounts two different persons, different banks, different bills, different names, different numbers We shared the same computer and the same wifi IP when we opened them and also, we live under the same address cause we are roommates.
Moving onwards we will manage each account on different computers and we will hire 2 internet providers to separate our connections however, we are afraid they might think we act wrongly trying to bypass their rules but in reality, we just didnt knew.
What do you think of this situation? should we be worried that our accounts get deactivated?

1412,"My product was misjudged on the principle of fair pricing, and I wrote that POA was always rejected","I read and inquired the fair pricing principle in detail, and I didnt violate any of them.
I dont know why Ive been rejected. I asked the relevant staff and they told me: its very strict now, even if its misjudged, it cant be approved.
Is that the truth?
My POA:
Dear Sir/Madam
I received an email about my products violation of fair pricing principles. We attach great importance to this issue. We will propose an action plan around whether my product violates fair pricing and Amazons sales policy. To prove that this is a wrong punishment.And we will report the detailed operation process and specific problems during this period to you.And submit our production qualification and market price comparison.
Complaint ID: XXXXXX
ASIN:XXXXX
The root cause of the problem: Due to the rising cost, we have revised the selling price of the product in Amazon.The product price adjustment triggers the fair pricing principle. The system thinks that I have violated the fair pricing principle, which makes my account unable to sell this product.
Heres an explanation of the four fair pricing principles that my product does not violate Amazons rules:
(1) Do we set reference prices of commodities or services that would mislead buyers?
The page of this commodity only has the selling price and does not provide a reference price. We have set a preferential price in the price limit, which is about one dollar cheaper than the sales price. This commodity does not have a unique design or packaging. There are many similar commodities on Amazon that can provide buyers with reference, so we often compare prices with our peers, including the prices of Amazon, AliExpress, Wal-Mart and other platforms. We have never considered how to mislead buyers to place orders. We encourage buyers to make more comparisons so as to enhance the competitiveness of our commodities and improve our supply chain system.
(2) Have we set too high a price for commodities or services to be significantly higher than the current price provided by Amazon inside and outside?
We have been selling this commodity since last year, usually around US $9. Due to the increase in transportation costs and commodityion costs from February to April, we adjusted the price to US $10 in February and US $13 in March, and kept this price range for sales in April. We have investigated the prices offered by Amazon both inside and outside. During the same period, other sellers on Amazon have adjusted the prices to between US $16 and US $19, and our prices have always been lower than theirs. Due to the very high transportation cost from February to April, we made an emergency replenishment of Amazon FBA warehouse. The air transportation price of aircraft has soared to US $20 1KG (2.22lb), while the weight of our commodities is 0.35 kg (0.7 lb). Its freight cost is already around US $7.
Therefore, the cost is:
The freight for the commodity is US $7 + Amazon FBA delivery freight US $3.48 + Amazon 15% commission US $1.50 = the cost US $13.
These do not include our manufacturing costs, advertising costs and operating costs. Therefore, we have to adjust the price to US $13. We are worried that price changes would affect the market, so we offset the inventory of Amazon FBA warehouses and overseas warehouses in the United States that already existed before March to ease the impact of soaring freight rates, thus reducing freight costs on average and keeping low prices. Therefore, when other sellers are selling for about US $19, we still keep the price at about US $13, thus maintaining the first sales result in this category. We have submitted a price graph from February to April in the attachment to prove that we have not set too high a price for this commodity.
We also provide the prices of other sellers of Amazon search page in the attachment, which you can use as reference and comparison.
(3) Do we sell the same item at a higher price for multiple items than for single items?
Our commodity is 500 disposable gloves, the price is around US $13, which is equal to the price of each glove at US $0.026 (13  500). This price is very low for Amazon and buyers because other sellers sold gloves at higher prices than us during the same period.
For example 1, the price of 500 gloves ASINb086c27fnx from other sellers is about US $18, which each glove is at US $0.036. The total price is US $5 higher than us and the unit price is US $0.01 higher than us.
For example 2, the price of 100 gloves ASINb085vnv7q1 from other sellers is about US $ 8.99, which each glove is at US $0.089. According to our quantity, their total price is which each glove is at US $32 higher than us and the unit price is which each glove is at US $0.063 higher than us.
When selling this commodity, we often compare the prices of the same type of commodities. Because we have not yet sold individual or other quantities of gloves. Therefore, there is no problem that the selling price of multiple pieces is higher than that of single pieces.
Do we set too high a freight rate for commodities?**
Our commodities are all sold by Amazon FBA, which have not sold self-delivered orders. We sold self-delivered commodities SKU: ST-500-pp. The purpose is to check whether the shopping cart is valid and to test the price range. During the testing and checking, A buyer placed an order., but we cancelled the order, deleted the inventory and removed the commodities. Order No.: 113-2594902-2920222. Amazon FBA freight is decided by Amazon. We have no right to set it. We have not sold self-delivered orders, so we have not charged buyers too much freight. We have always insisted on selling by Amazon FBA to improve the weight and conversion rate of commodities and to give customers a satisfactory logistics experience.
The above is our reply to the four provisions of Amazons fair pricing principle. We have not violated the principle of fair pricing.
2.Our description of Amazons sales policy:
1 Amazons sales policy and sellers code of conduct (Always provide accurate information to Amazon and our buyers?)
On the page, we detailed the product information, including quantity, weight, material and packaging. Our page also clearly states the function and purpose of this product. We have not misled buyers into exaggerating or falsely promoting the use of this product. We also didnt sell fake products, because the trademark ownership of this product belongs to us. Our product pictures are also strictly in accordance with Amazons standards, and all products are clearly visible.
2 do we sell health and health care products, disinfectant products (including disinfectants, wipes or spray) and food products (such as canned food) or products banned by Amazon?
Its just an ordinary transparent plastic PE disposable glove. We also indicate the purpose of this product on the pagekitchen food handling, cleaning, hairdressing, Party dining, car washing and so on
Its classification in Amazon is:
Tools & Home Improvement
Safety & Security>Personal Protective Equipment>Hand & Arm Protection>Lab, Safety & Work Gloves>Disposable Gloves>Non-Sterile Gloves)
We checked the relevant policies, Amazon did not prohibit the sale of such products. because our gloves are not medical gloves or epidemic prevention gloves. They are only disposable gloves for household use and are daily consumables. Our description on the webpage is also normal. You can check our sales page: https://www.amazon.com/dp/XXXXX
Therefore, we have not violated Amazons sales policy because of our products. The entire product is in line with Amazons requirements and does not violate Amazons regulations
Our products have been on sale at Amazon last year and have been on sale for $8.99. Due to the recent cost problem, we need to modify the price, but our price ceiling is set very low, which makes us easily misunderstood by the system as triggering the fair pricing principle. In fact, our price is still much lower than that of other sellers after modification. So we think the punishment is a miscarriage of justice, and we hope to resume the sale of this product as soon as possible.
.How can I ensure that I do not violate Amazons fair pricing policy now and in the future?**
(1) We have organized the companys staff to study the fair pricing policy of Amazon in detail again, and taken this review as a case study and analysis. We have established a strict application process for price and freight revision. There is a special person is responsible for this work.
(2) The pricing of products sold in Amazon will compare the prices and freight of other sellers at the same time, including the quotations of Wal-Mart, AliExpress and other e-commerce platforms. Each time the price is revised by no more than 10%, a smooth periodic curve will be set for the price change, and buyers will try their best to buy good and cheap products.
(3) We have been trying our best to control costs, always caring about changes in raw materials and transportation costs, and trying to adjust prices to normal levels in the first place.
After lifting the complaint, our improvement measures are as follows:
(1)Raw materials: at present, the price of raw materials has skyrocketed. The raw materials on the market are being snapped up by various countries and are in short supply.But this situation is expected to pass soon. It is our goal to ensure the quality of products and reduce the purchase cost of raw materials.We have reserved a large number of raw materials in the production workshop in advance, and it is expected that they can be supplied for another month.We are actively contacting suppliers of raw materials from all sides to meet production needs and strive for sufficient stock on Amazon.
(2)Workers: At present, the wages of the workers in our workshop have all reached 80 dollars a day. we have tried our best to recruit them. In order to meet the needs of the staff, we to implement the plan of salary increase next month.Only if the production line is stabilized, the labor cost of the product can be reduced.
(3) Logistics and transportation: now air transportation is very expensive. We have arranged to use ships and trucks to deliver goods to Amazons FBA warehouse this month. We are trying to reduce the logistics cost. When many other sellers are still using air transportation, we are already in action. At present, some goods have been delivered to the FBA warehouse by ship and truck. This will also reduce the price of this product later. The recent FBA shipment plans for this product are shipped by ship and truck.
(4)Our staff: we will have pre job training and assessment for our staff, and let them study systematically in Amazon seller University. We also purchased a batch of books to study Amazons various policies. In the future, such low-level mistakes should be avoided. At the same time, the goal is made to optimize all aspects of the product, including packaging, quality inspection, and logistics.
product is produced by our direct factory. There are no distributors and agents, so we are cheaper than other sellers.
We will submit in the attachment:
Price curve picture of products from February to April

1413,Suspended Listing Evaluation / Amazon Fair Pricing/ Multi Pack Abuse,"WE have been going back and forth with Seller performance in what seems a bot loop. For some reason we are not hitting the proper keywords or phrases in our appeal. We appreciate any and all guidance.
Most recent email is below:
Hello,
Thank you for submitting your plan of action. We reviewed your appeal and determined that it is missing the following information. Please include the missing information listed below in your plan of action:
 Greater detail on the root cause(s) of the Pricing Multi-Pack Abuse.
 Greater detail on the actions you have taken to resolve the identified issues.
 Greater detail on the steps you have taken to prevent Pricing Multi-Pack Abuse going forward.
Here is our POA
Dear Seller Performance team,
We have received a notice regarding Price Gouging and violation of Amazon.com Fair Pricing Policy.
We have investigated and found the root cause of this issue to be the price per unit cannot be significantly higher than recent prices offered on or off Amazon.We have also found selling multiple units of a product for more per unit than that of a single unit of the same product. It is imperative that when selling multi packs of an item, the price of the multi pack does not exceed the standard price per unit of a single item. Additionally setting a shipping fee on a product that is excessive as well as reference price on a product or service that misleads customers. For other items, we have found that our automatic repricing software, Feedvisor- has automatically repriced some items to a price that was too high in accordance with Amazon Fair Pricing Policy. Many of our suppliers have raised their cost for their items due to the situation for Covid 19. We were unaware at the time of the Amazon fair pricing policy but have now taken a look and are accustomed to its policies. Previously, we would set repricer and price based on what other Amazon sellers are selling items at. We realize now this is no longer the proper procedure and we must reprice and price items based on current market pricing on other retailers website such as Walmart and Target etc. .
The actions you have taken to resolve the issue
In order to fix this issue, we have removed all listings temporarily as our
All listings which have received a notice regarding fair pricing violation have been removed. Remaining items have been checked and adjusted.
Example of removed or adjusted ASINS include but are not limited to:
XYZ
XYZ
XYZ
XYZ etc.
We will review all our pricing to make sure that the maximum pricing on out repricer is in line with Amazon.com Fair pricing policy. We have reviewed the fair pricing policy in depth and have assigned Michael and Sarah two of our employees to make sure our repricer is set correctly to fall in line with the Amazon fair pricing policy as well as sort through all our inventory to insure it is properly priced. We have also provided Michael and Sarah with a checklist of standards that must be checked against every item that is a multi pack in our inventory. We will be sure to review all these items of multi packs and insure compliance with the Amazon.com Fair Pricing Policy as well as Pricing Multi-Pack Abuse.
The process will include 1. Checking each item on other websites such as Walmart and Target before pricing.2. They will consider current public carrier rates, reasonable handling charges, as well as buyer perception when determining a shipping rate 3. For items with multiple units of a product they will not price it for more per unit than that of a single unit of the same product based on the price found on other website such as Walmart and Target .4. Double check the list price before selling to insure it complies with Amazon fair pricing standards.
Michael and Sarah are now well advised of Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy and have a guide to follow before listing each product. They are also advised of the Multi price
Additionally, they will submit the file for review before uploading to a manager to insure that no errors were created.
For future items list price and average price will be factored into a formula to calculate what our Maximum advertised price can be. We realize now that setting an unreasonably high price will lead to a negative customer experience. We had no intention of price gouging but do realize that it can put Amazon PR, customer confidence and image at risk. We have taken it upon ourselves to review the any educational videos and documentation in seller central in relation to price gouging and have taken the necessary steps to better educate our team an ourselves to abide by these policies.
If pricing for our items have increased cost as in a time of emergency such as today, we will no longer offer the product if the price is above the list price on Amazon.com and must be within reason of the reference price amount.We are also are responsible for ensuring that the reference prices you provide to us remain current.
We will make sure that all out prices including shipping costs when compared to other offers current or previous will not harm our customers trust.
The steps you have taken to prevent the issue going forward
We have also trained Sarah and Michael to price items based on the larger retailers and not based on what other sellers have the items currently priced at. We now have a process implement before listing every product to check the other retailers first before listing to insure the pricing is fair as well as They will consider current public carrier rates, reasonable handling charges, as well as buyer perception when determining a shipping rate. For items with multiple units of a product they will not price it for more per unit than that of a single unit of the same product Double check the list price before selling to insure it complies with Amazon fair pricing standards.
We will make sure that all reference prices on our items are accurate in line with recent prices and not significantly higher. Additionally, we will also make sure all our shipping fees are accurate as well and not excessive.
All in all we were short staff and overwhelmed during this Covid 19 Period. We did not have enough time to put the proper help into our pricing strategies. However; we have made it a point to take care of this mistakes and implement these new policies and procedures for the future so this does not occur again",Account Health

I did and within hours of my notice i was deactivated. I accept that I sourced badly for that product, but amazons fee covered half my price.
1 of my inactive listings was created when other sellers were available. I matched their prices. now there are no sellers but me.
the policy says
Setting a price on a product or service that is significantly higher than recent prices offered on is a violation.
I cant prove it now but I was compareable on the low end I think to other sellers 2 weeks ago.
also this is a heavy item. Again amazon fee is half my price. Amazons portion covers shipping and fees, my portion is supposed to cover the item cost, shipping, packaging and profit. I think im missing something.
price now $11.99
fba fee $5.86
shipping and packaging $5.00
Product 0.25
profit .88
I will be able to cover just the FBA fee at $5.33. I make no profit at $11.11. I would like to appreal and ask questions, but I dont want to be deactivated for doing so.
My next item that is priced too high. is being compared to a price that is $0.30 over the FBA fees. I can not cover product cost, shipping, packaging, and profit with $0.30.
How do I fix these with out being kicked off for violating the policy?
How do I question what is wrong with the other inactive listings with out getting kicked off for violating a policy?
Im a new seller and im probably missing something. Thank you!",Account Health

Ive been going back and forth with Amazon, talking to multiple supervisors on the phone, I just need a clear answer and some help, please.
I did not even sell a single product. I simply added a price underneath an already existing listing BY MISTAKE - and removed it the next morning. I didnt sell a single one of the products, nor did I plan on it. I dont know how I am supposed to submit a purchase order or anything along those lines, when I didnt even sell anything. Ive explained this to Amazon multiple times, and they keep sending that same email over and over again.
Thank you
Here is the POA I have written, could anyone please provide me feedback? Ive been trying to reach out to Amazon all day for this issue with no help.
Dear Seller Performance,
I am the CEO of Successful Tomorrow, and I am responding to the recent trademark infringement report received.
Root cause of the infringement:
I listed an item that I did not have brand approval to sell on Amazon.
I entered the ASIN on Seller Central under an already existing listing by mistake. It was not my intention to sell their products, especially as counterfeit.
I was not aware of and did not check for intellectual property ownership prior to list the branded item. I only checked if I was able to sell on the Amazon App.
Actions taken to resolve the issue with the rights owner
I have deleted the item from our inventory. Not a single one of the products were sold.
We sent emails to XXXX@XXX.com explaining the situation.
We are going to keep on buying our products only from authorized distributors and brand owners that authorize us to sell their product on amazon.
We will keep on selling only authentic and original items.
We are committed to operating our amazon account in accordance with Amazons policies.
Details on how you will prevent future complaints:
I have reviewed Amazons policies regarding authenticity and IP complaints.
In the future, even though we are able to sell the product according to Amazon App we will consult and check for the brand permission to sell on Amazon.
We are going to buy products from authorized distributors and get authorized by the brands to sell on amazon.
In closing, please consider our appeal. We accept full responsibility for this error and will make sure it is not repeated.",Account Health

I am sure you can appreciate how much hard work it takes to get a product at that level, especially if you are a two-people husband wife family business!

A week of no sales and damaged rankings and 500+ inventory stranded, with no clue whats gone wrong and why and where the alleged infringement has happened.
And when I email the notice-disputes amazon address, they reply back with the generic template that I need to submit documents to prove my right. My products is extremely simple and generic bundle of standard items - not much chance of infringement anyways!

I opened a seller central account, sent in inventory, then added my bank account and I was suspended shortly after. I had no idea why. It said ""Your Amazon seller account has been deactivated in accordance with section 3 of Amazons Business Solutions Agreement. We found that your account is related to another account that may not be used to sell on the site. As a result, you may no longer sell on Amazon.com through this account.

I sent in an appeal asking for more details then a few messages before I got a response with a link to be able to call customer service.
On the first call, the representative told me the suspension was due to a registration issue with global accounts. So I sorted out that problem and finished the global registration process submitted additional information to address that I have solved the root issue, along with documents to prove my identity( phone bills, banking statements, utility bills).
After no response after and a few calls, the representative told me there was an other issue was due to a related account and told me the first three letters of that account. It turns out my son has an account by that name and it has not been used since 2016. It is still in good standing. Completely different products, but we live in the same household. The two accounts do not share anything in common except the address. The representative told me to submit invoices from both accounts to prove that it is a completely different business selling distinctive items. However, for my sons account he could only find a paypal email for the inventory purchased back in 2016, not a full on normal invoice. The representative on the last call told me he expects that to be rejected automatically because it is a paypal invoice.

1421,2nd POA Denied for item Used Sold as New,"Hello all,
Im about to give up trying to get this ASIN relisted. I have sent in 2 POA but both were rejected within minutes of me sending them in. Looks like Amazon did not even read them since they responded so quickly. I sincerely do not know what else I would have to write down for Amazon to approve this. This ASIN is for 2 small rubber seals along with a small metal filter, the item comes blistered packed from factory.This is not an important ASIN as we have only sold 3 of these items since we been selling on Amazon but I would like to correct this because we want to make sure we do everything correctly as Amazon requires.
This was the buyers comments that led to the listing being removed. Buyer requested a return but never returned the items. Also, never left any Negative Feedback. We did issue a refund when the return was opened.
Buyer Comment: Package had clearly been opened and one of the rubber seals was marked and slightly damaged.
This is our latest POA. If anyone has any suggestions on what we are stating that is wrong or what we need to add please help us out.
The following addresses the specific ASINs listed in the notice:
ASIN- B01D1CL0FC
We take full responsibility for the situation that led the buyer to believe He/She received a used item.
As per the buyer message that led to product removal:
Buyer Comment: Package had clearly been opened and one of the rubber seals was marked and slightly damaged.
We have refunded the buyer in full for the item and addressed our warehouse with the below information as well.
 The root cause that led to the complaints about the condition of your items.
We reviewed The Voice of The Customer as well as the message the buyer sent and found that this item was sent opened from our warehouse or damaged in transit causing the blister pack to open and damage the item inside.
Item could have been returned to us opened and we reshipped the item without checking
There was a gap in our quality control that caused this item to be shipped without us inspecting the item before shipping
The actions you have taken to resolve the complaints about the condition of your items.
We are rechecking all our stock to make sure there are no defective or open items and will no longer ship these items in bubble envelopes to prevent damages. We will ship this item in a cardboard box, add protection to prevent any damages in the future.
All our returns are automatically set aside for inspection and will not be reshipped.
We have also carefully reviewed all Amazon policies, especially the ones related to Product Detail Page Rules.
 The steps you have taken to prevent future complaints about the condition of your items.
We are inspecting all blister packs before shipment to make sure there is no damage to the item or that we do not ship any open blister pack. We are packing these items in a cardboard box instead of a plastic bubble envelope that led the item to be damaged and a customer complaint.
We have since started shipping this item in a cardboard box with a load rate of 20Lbs and a burst rating of 125#
We are enforcing quality control of every item before shipping, so this does not happen again.
Sourcing: Are you sourcing the product from a trusted supplier?
Our sources are either the manufacturer or their direct distributor. We have included our Invoices from the past year as requested by Amazon.
We are Authorized retailers for the brand and item, so all our Inventory is brand new.

My Amazon Seller account has been sadly deactivated for more than a month now, and Ive sent many appeals+invoices. The last appeal I sent that got rejected is below, please provide feedback. I accidentally sent a customer the wrong item, got an authenticity complaint, and now unfortunately my invoices arent being verified. They keep giving the same robotic response, asking for the same invoices and a greater plan of action. My account being deactivated is hurting me so much. Please pray for me. Thank you and be safe everybody.
""Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team,
I hope you are doing well and being safe. Below are invoices attachments and an updated plan of action which was asked for in the email. Please take my updated plan of action seriously as it was prepared with extreme consideration and time. I am sending this information to have my account reactivated after being sadly deactivated for almost a month now. Thank you for working with me through this patiently, looking forward to having my account reactivated.
-1) Copies of additional invoices or receipts from your supplier issued in the last 365 days for the ASINs listed at the bottom of this email:
Attached are 5 invoices of tortilla presses from 4 different companies. Contact details are available for all my suppliers. Also attached are invoices for other items that I get supplied from trusted manufacturers. (I believe the first two attachments, one of them being older are for ASIN: B00HWEIKZO and the third attachment is for ASIN: B00PBXQMX0. A few of these tortilla presses accidentally got mixed up while shipping). Please understand ASIN: B00HWEIKZO was purchased in a closeout sale from the company High Prime Enterprises LLC The details of everything are in my plan of action below.
-2) An updated plan of action that explains:
Greater detail on the issue(s) that you believe caused the complaints about the authenticity of your items:
Customer accidentally got shipped the wrong item. ASIN B00HWEIKZO is a brand product that is made in the country Colombia and I carry more than one brand of manual cast iron tortilla presses as you can see in the invoices attached. Unfortunately being purely understaffed, I accidentally mixed up a couple of different tortilla presses while preparing the biggest load of orders Ive ever received for shipment. I was severely understaffed because of COVID-19 and I made a mistake while packing. They were shelved right next to each other and look very similar. Tortilla presses are the smallest item in my inventory, and the employee who manages that section of the warehouse was sadly absent. It was a single alone mistake, not a company mistake.
Short staff due to scary COVID-19 quarantine conditions. We were forced to slow down operations and some disorganization then occurred. Also unfortunately at the time, Amazon said FBA was unavailable because COVID-19 slowed the FBA operations down too about a month ago.
The best commercial shipping technique wasnt used. All the tortilla presses I have were put into plastic bags, wrapped by bubble wrap, then put into a USPS flat rate envelope. All the different tortilla presses I have were prepared for shipment in the exact same fashion. And with a short staff, sadly confusion happened. I stuck the wrong shipping labels onto a couple packages when more than 365 orders were received in one day.
Possibly because I bought ASIN B00HWEIKZO from a business who does closeout sales and not a an established distributor like me. I very apologetically didnt fully comprehend Amazons policy of making sure all listed items are from suppliers that can easily be easily verified, as from an established distributor channel or an Amazon trusted manufacturer as I do for the other items in my inventory to ensure authenticity. High Prime Enterprises LLC., is a company that specializes in doing closeout sales. However, this big issue with Amazon arose over my invoices not being verified, so I will no longer sell any items I sourced from High Prime Enterprises LLC. on Amazon and I will never purchase any inventory from High Prime Enterprises LLC. again. I will only sell items sourced from Amazon trusted distributors and manufacturers. Like how I supply my main line of items of propane gas stoves and big steel pots!
A possible complaint due to these ASINS being a manual hand use cooking item. A little technique has to be used when preparing the dough that is going to be hand pressed when using the tortilla press item.
 Greater detail on the actions you have taken to resolve the issue(s) that caused the complaints about the authenticity of your items:
I instantly gave every single customer that made a concern or complaint a 100% refund. Wishing for their safety, I never make them go through the hassle of returning the item back.
Communicated with the customer in a very apologetic and respectful manner. Explaining to them a technical error, by me the seller occurred by sending the wrong item. And a full refund has been initiated, plus they dont have to return the item back!
I canceled a dozen orders and made sure customers were refunded before shipping when I realized different tortilla press items had been packed and prepared in the exact same fashion.
Now no longer listing any brand variation tortilla presses or any items bought through a closeout sale on amazon. Only listing items from fully established distributors and Amazon trusted manufacturers. My company always fully disposes of any items that arent in brand new condition. As it is my companys policy to sell only brand new items.
I fully cleaned up and reorganized my Amazon inventory. No longer listed any tortilla presses. Put into place daily inventory checks of the items in my warehouse to make sure they perfectly update and correlate with my Amazon inventory. While increasing the frequency of routine inventory checks as orders increased. And also always performing deep quality control checks before shelving the products for inventory.
Learned how to use FBA services to its full potential by watching videos and reading seller forums to make our operations most efficient. Also bought more shipping supplies such as bubble wrap, sealed bags, etc.
Greater detail on the steps you have taken to prevent future complaints about the authenticity of your items:
Carefully reviewed all of Amazons policies and guidelines, especially the metrics Amazon provided on where we under performed. We understand how grave and wrong it is to sell an inauthentic item. Also we now understand how important it is to have suppliers that can be easily verified. Going forward to ensure a mishap like this never occurs, we wont sell any items bought through a closeout sale channel. Respecting Amazons great service we wont list the ASINs that had a concern with Amazon. We will only sell items that were bought from trusted manufacturers and official distributors! This will help us maintain a great seller status and get good customer feedback.
Making sure all items are shipped in their commercial brand box.
I now have a special section in warehouse strictly organized by Amazon inventory by amazon SKU because Amazon sales rocketed and it has surpassed my expectations. This inventory is closely monitored to make sure order quality is great, trustworthy, and ready for shipping. While aiming to implement FBA to its full potential. This will make our business a lot more efficient and organzied, while taking a work load off our shoulders.

5.Only source from official manufacturers and trusted distributors. I will no longer purchase or sell any items from the company, High Prime Enterprises LLC. That was the company that sold me the ASIN B00HWEIKZO in a closeout sale transaction. My main line of items is propane stoves and big steel pots. Sourced from the most trusted manufacturers/suppliers, invoices for these items are different than the tortilla press invoices. (All invoices attached). Our main manufacturers/distributor suppliers supply some of the biggest brands and businesses within the USA, including other Amazon Sellers. ""

1424,Received a negative feedback that threatens my account,"Received this yesterday from a customer:
Customer Service failure the tracker said it was delivered on May 2nd, The order details said the arrival time was May 5 thru 12. Contacting the seller - every communication was IGNORED. Had they stepped up and apologized and said they were doing everything they could to correct their mistakes, I would not be making a negative review.
It does not meet any of the criteria for removal so I cant even request removal. So, the facts, Customer messaged me twice. Both times I responded. I responded with this;
You are eligible to request a refund under the A-to-z Guarantee if You have not received your package and three days have passed since the maximum estimated delivery date or the tracking shows a delivery confirmation, whichever is sooner. Note: Amazon also requires you to wait 48 hours after contacting the seller before you are eligible to request a refund.
To request a refund on an eligible order:
Go to Your Orders 
Locate your order in the list and click Problem with order
Select Package didnt arrive from the list
Select Request refund
Enter your comment in the text box.
Select Submit
Note: Refund requests can take a few days to investigate. Amazon will notify you of their decision via the email address associated with your account. To view the status of your request, locate your order in the list on the Your Orders page and select Problem with order.
To receive the maximum refund allowed you need to select Package didnt arrive
To which their response (you know to the responses I never made) was:
(SIC)This is absurd, the tracker said this was delivered May 2nd, the estimator said when I tried to report it not arrining that I could not file a claim until 3 days after the 12th. This was poor customer service to imply it was delivered and say they had until the 12th.
So customer lied that I never responded. I always respond and I respond usually within minutes as I did to every message this person sent.
So my worry is Amazon is extending their pause on account performance metrics to June 1st. This is hitting my 90 day metrics at 7%. Lets not even talk about how tracking shows delivery on this item 10 days before the guaranteed delivery date. I did buy shipping through Amazon, followed all the rules, shipped product the day it was ordered using 1st class package. Responsibly had already moved my delivery times out to 10 days because I know the Postal service is having delays
And now Im at risk of being suspended. Ive had 3 negs ever. 2015, 2018 and now.
Is there any appeal to the feedback? I hear of people being warned of suspension for asking outside of the feedback manager.",Account Health

1428,"Please Help! Suspended for Fair Pricing Policy, but We Werent Price Gouging","We were suspended on 4/14 for violating the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy and submitted a POA the same day. The problem is that we feel that we were not Price Gouging and provided plenty of supporting evidence and purchase invoices to prove that the price we were selling at is reasonable. However, Amazon responded early this morning saying they needed more information. Here is some backstory to help paint the picture of the situation any help would be very greatly appreciated as I really dont know what our next response should look like.
End of March:
We are a distributor in the health and beauty category that historically have not sold direct to the consumer. With that said, we had been considering jumping into the Amazon ring for some time and when COVID-19 hit and about 90% of the businesses that we sell to closed their doors, we decided to dip our toe in with a couple hundred ASINs that we had healthy stock on and knew would sell well.
4/1:
We received a notification of that we were violating the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy on a 90-pack of disposable gloves that we were selling at $11.00. After receiving the violation, we realized that we were actually losing money at this price and thought it was crazy that Amazon considered this to be a violation. We simply deleted this ASIN from our inventory and moved on.
4/10:
One of the ASINs that we had been selling since 3/31 was a gallon bottle of disinfectant. One other seller was selling this item at $69.99 and after doing some research, we quickly realized that they were actually buying it from us through our distributor portal and we were dropshipping it for them. We decided to start selling the item as well and set our price at $54.95, which is about a 35% margin after our cost, shipping costs, and seller fees. We could have went just below the price he had it listed at, but felt like that would be too high so we set the margin at 35%, which seemed reasonable considering that we are used to selling to other businesses who then turn around and sell it to consumers for what would be around this margin. We realize that you cant sell everything at this margin on Amazon due to the competition level on most ASIN, but we identified this as one that could be sold at this price as the only other seller was buying through us. Now, before we began selling the item, we had dropshipped this item over 200 times within a few day period for the other seller, so he clearly had a nice little gravy train going while not putting in alot of effort. Here is where it gets interesting. Once that dried up when we began selling the item, it must have made him mad and not realizing that we were the other seller, he decided to purchase a gallon from us on Amazon. Once it arrived, he requested a return stating that we were price gouging, left a negative feedback stating price gouging, left a product review stating price gouging, and likely also reported the listing for price gouging.
4/11:
Our listing was deactivated due to a high potential price notification. No matter what we lowered the price to, the flag remained. Knowing that the other seller had reported us the previous day, we thought that might have something to do with why we were now seeing the listing flagged for high price. We however, had not received a Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy violation so thought it could also be some type of glitch or error. We opened a case with Amazon asking what the issue was and they responded saying that it had been reset and to try setting a price again. We set the price back to 54.99 and the listing began working again with no price error.
4/13:
Right before the close of business, we received a notification that the ASIN had been removed for violation of the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy and we needed to appeal it to have the listing reinstated. Knowing that Amazon would need purchase invoices for this ASIN, I asked our purchasing agent to send them to me. Unfortunately, she had already left for the day so I assumed it would be fine to wait until the next morning to submit the appeal since it said we had 24 hours.
4/14:
Shortly after midnight we received a notification that our account had been suspended less than 10 hours after we received the notification that the ASIN was removed.
Below is the suspension email we received, along with our plan of action, and response that Amazon sent this morning. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. We understand that thousands of other sellers are in similar situations right now so we really appreciate taking the time to read this and help with your feedback.

Our POA Response:
The Root Cause of the Issue:
 We received two violations of the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy  ASINs: XXXXXX1, XXXXXX2
 We were selling ASIN XXXXXX1 at $54.99, which is a 35% profit margin after cost of the product ($12.50), shipping cost ($15.00 average), and Amazon selling fees ($8.25). This is a standard profit margin that is considered acceptable for any business model.
 ASIN XXXXXX1 is being sold at a similar or higher price point online at many other websites including:
Tanforless.com $54.99 - link removed
Atlantictan.com: $49.95 - link removed
Coolwort.com: $74.20 - link removed
ASIN XXXXXX1 was being offered by one other seller on Amazon at the time we were removed. They were priced at approx. $69.99, much higher than our offer of $54.99
Comparable gallon disinfectants to ASIN XXXXXX1 are currently being offered on Amazon at a similar or higher price points:
B07QDBM1HS: $79.99
B005GWVJ1G: $67.48
B00FE1CE9A: $51.78
B00RR5WBQ2: $56.73
B08688ZMVW: $59.39
When diluted with water per the directions for ASIN XXXXXX1, this product makes 64 gallons of disinfectant concentrate. Many of the comparable ASINs above makes less disinfectant concentrate, but is being sold at a similar or higher price.
We were selling ASIN XXXXXX2 at $11.00, which is a NEGATIVE 10.45% profit margin after cost of the product ($5.50), shipping cost ($5.00 average), and Amazon selling fees ($1.65). We were actually losing money at this selling price.
ASIN XXXXXX2 is being sold at a similar or higher price point online at many other websites including:
Nordstromrack.com 1: $9.97 - link removed
Walmart.com: $19.95  link removed
Comparable powder free gloves to ASIN XXXXXX2 are currently being offered on Amazon at a similar or higher price points:
B086SQ86Y8: $14.99 + $9.99 shipping
B086D7YLYH: $22.80
B086DKTS8N: $17.99
B085XTJRT2: $19.43
Actions we have taken to resolve the issue:
We have researched and provided supporting documentation in the root cause that our prices on both XXXXXX1 and XXXXXX2 are within a comparable price range with other sellers on Amazon and other websites online, which confirms that we are in compliance with Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy
We have researched and provided documentation in the root cause that our prices on both XXXXXX1 and XXXXXX2 are within a comparable price range when compared to similar products on Amazon, which confirms that we are in compliance with Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy
We have taken the additional step of lowering our price to $49.95 on ASIN XXXXXX1, which matches the lowest price of any website that currently has this product in stock.
We have deleted ASIN XXXXXX2 from our Amazon Inventory as we were already losing money on this ASIN and cannot continue to offer it at the price we had it at or lower the price any further
Steps we have taken to prevent the issue going forward:
We have set our price at $49.95 for ASIN XXXXXX1 and have confirmed that this price is in compliance with Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy and have provided supporting evidence and documentation in the steps above.
We have audited the rest of the SKUs that we have listed on Amazon to ensure that they are also in compliance with Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy and have the ability to provide supporting documentation for any of the SKUs that we offer.
We have added additional steps to the listing process to make sure that any new listings that we add to Amazon are also in compliance with Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy prior to creating the listing or adding our offer to an existing ASIN.

"" Hello,
Thank you for submitting your appeal. We reviewed the information you submitted and determined that it is missing the following information. Please include the missing information listed below in your plan of action:
 Greater detail on the root cause(s) of the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing policy.
 Greater detail on the actions you have taken to resolve the identified issues.
 Greater detail on the steps you have taken to prevent Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing* policy going forward.
Has your account been deactivated in error?
If you believe there has been an error, please tell us why. Your explanation should include the following information
 How your listing(s) have not violated Amazons selling policies.
 How are you able to ensure you currently and in future do not violate Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy.""
After receiving the response above, I also contacted the account health team and the person I spoke with was hard to understand and was unable to help alot. She did state that the internal notes showed that we needed to be more specific on the process we have in place to comply going forward. She also said that our root cause and actions weve taken to resolve the issue were fine as the internal notes didnt mention them, but I am wondering why the response from Amazon Seller Performance states they need greater detail on them if that is the case? One other thing she mentioned was that we could break the shipping out separately and charge the customer on the ASINs that received the violations instead of building it into the price and offering free shipping. This point may be helpful to other sellers who are also suspended for similar issues.
Thanks to everyone for taking the time to read about our situation. Before sending another response to Amazon, id love some feedback from the community on this if there is any. I look forward to any responses we get!",Account Health

1431,POA denied on Used Sold as New,"Hello all,
Im about to give up trying to get this ASIN relisted. I have sent in 2 POA but both were rejected within minutes of me sending them in. Looks like Amazon did not even read them since they responded so quickly. I sincerely do not know what else I would have to write down for Amazon to approve this. This ASIN is for 2 small rubber seals along with a small metal filter, the item comes blistered packed from factory.This is not an important ASIN as we have only sold 3 of these items since we been selling on Amazon but I would like to correct this because we want to make sure we do everything correctly as Amazon requires.
This was the buyers comments that led to the listing being removed. Buyer requested a return but never returned the items. Also, never left any Negative Feedback. We did issue a refund when the return was opened.
Buyer Comment: Package had clearly been opened and one of the rubber seals was marked and slightly damaged.
This is our latest POA. If anyone has any suggestions on what we are stating that is wrong or what we need to add please help us out.
The following addresses the specific ASINs listed in the notice:
ASIN- B01D1CL0FC
We take full responsibility for the situation that led the buyer to believe He/She received a used item.
As per the buyer message that led to product removal:
Buyer Comment: Package had clearly been opened and one of the rubber seals was marked and slightly damaged.
We have refunded the buyer in full for the item and addressed our warehouse with the below information as well.
 The root cause that led to the complaints about the condition of your items.
We reviewed The Voice of The Customer as well as the message the buyer sent and found that this item was sent opened from our warehouse or damaged in transit causing the blister pack to open and damage the item inside.
Item could have been returned to us opened and we reshipped the item without checking
There was a gap in our quality control that caused this item to be shipped without us inspecting the item before shipping
The actions you have taken to resolve the complaints about the condition of your items.
We are rechecking all our stock to make sure there are no defective or open items and will no longer ship these items in bubble envelopes to prevent damages. We will ship this item in a cardboard box, add protection to prevent any damages in the future.
All our returns are automatically set aside for inspection and will not be reshipped.
We have also carefully reviewed all Amazon policies, especially the ones related to Product Detail Page Rules.
 The steps you have taken to prevent future complaints about the condition of your items.
We are inspecting all blister packs before shipment to make sure there is no damage to the item or that we do not ship any open blister pack. We are packing these items in a cardboard box instead of a plastic bubble envelope that led the item to be damaged and a customer complaint.
We have since started shipping this item in a cardboard box with a load rate of 20Lbs and a burst rating of 125#
We are enforcing quality control of every item before shipping, so this does not happen again.
Sourcing: Are you sourcing the product from a trusted supplier?
Our sources are either the manufacturer or their direct distributor. We have included our Invoices from the past year as requested by Amazon.
We are Authorized retailers for the brand and item, so all our Inventory is brand new.
Our Distributor is:

1434,Feedback Removal Request Auto denied by BOT twice,"Hello,
Hoping someone can help. I used feedback removal tool to request seller feedback be removed as it was a product review. Denied by BOT first time (not that unusual). I then re-opened ticket to ask for human review and that ticket was closed within 10 seconds with the same canned BOT response. A minute later I got the message (below) indicating that someone from the feedback team is going to get back to me. Of course this request was closed twice and no one from feedback team ever looked at this or got back to me so now I am stuck with no where to turn. All my previous experiences with feedback removal requests have been BOT first review then, if needed, open a case and within a day or two a human would respond with their decision. Email signed by them and request for survey on were you satisfied. Did not ever get the followup message from human review.
This strange behavior started happening during covid and I suspect that support was so overwhelmed that they suspended human reviews of feedback removal and were using BOT for all feedback removal requests. Regardless would like to get this issue resolved.

1436,Fraudulent Trademark Infringement Complaint,"I had a product removed due to a a trademark complaint. It referenced a trademark number and an email address at a law firm (Ill call them the Acme Law Firm) as the rights owner.
My product quite obviously doesnt infringe on the trademark, so I contacted the Acme Law Firm to sort it out. Turns out they didnt file the complaint and they didnt represent the trademark owner in any matter at all.
Someone was able to file a fraudulent trademark infringement complaint against me (along with about 60 other ASINs in the same complaint). Notice-dispute is neither willing nor capable of comprehending what happened and responding intelligently. I am receiving incoherent cut-and-pasted responses, often with self-contradictory information and requests.
The Acme Law Firm has been very helpful. They want this resolved as much as I do, since someone is misusing their name. They want to find out who. I would like to provide them with a contact at Amazon who will be able to read, understand, and resolve this for them and me.
My questions are 1) who can I escalate the case to after notice-dispute has failed to act appropriately? 2) Who can Acme Law contact to get Amazons assistance in finding the identity of the perpetrator and ensuring this doesnt happen again?

1437,One Negative Review Leaves My ODR At 25%,"Hello everyone.
I recently started started selling on Amazon again after a year off. I restarted small and only have a handful of products that I ship seller fulfilled. After selling a pair of golfing gloves to a woman out in Texas she messaged me a week later to say that the packaged arrived empty. I personally packaged and shipped the gloves off myself using USPS so I knew that her claims were untrue.
I contacted Seller Support and was told to report a violation to open a case log. Once I did that my only response from Seller Support was that an investigation was pending and the results of the investigation would not be made public due to their policies.
This buyer began messaging me every two hours to claim that her package arrived empty and was threatening to sue me in small claims court in her county if I did not ship her a replacement or refund her. All the while my case with Seller Support remained active with a status of transferred in the case log.
Eventually I decided to refund this buyer out of pure exhaustions from the constant messages and threats of litigation. I knew that I wasnt in the wrong and that I had shipped out the package properly but I had no other choice. I felt slightly abandoned by Amazon and Seller Support but I was ready to move on and keep selling products.
Then the customer leaves me a negative review which made my Order Defect Rate skyrocket to an alarming 25%

We need help to reactivate our account.
The reason for deactivation was: we were offering items that maybe inauthentic nobody claim, only a random audit. The audit was by 3 asins, we asked for their return and deleted the listings.
We purchased the items in a retail online, We dont have the invoice, only the orders sending by them by email. We asked for an invoice for these products in these stores and they answered that it is no possibility for them to generate an invoice. All three stores said that receipts sent by email, which one we can also check in our history orders, are valid receipts. We sent these orders to demonstrate the authenticity but apparently this is not enough. We dont have anything else.
We have sent five submissions explaining that, but the answer is always the same: We received your submission but do not have enough information to reactivate your account
We have read a lot of information about online arbitrage and we didnt find anything concrete, only opinions it is legal or not?It s prohibit in Amazon or not? We really appreciate it if somebody can clear that.
We are very small entrepreneurship, we dont have either a formal company, but our intention is to sell various products for some months to have the necessary capital to design and register our product, brand, and business.
Here we transcript our plan of action in order to get your suggestions to improve it:
Dear Seller Performance Team
We are writing today in regard to doubts about the authenticity of the following products ASIN: B00T3WGWNK, B073XL1LK1, and B071XGZDLY, that derived in the deactivation of our account.
We consider there is a mistake because these products are authentic, also but for our side, we did not ask for an invoice and we only have orders confirmations.
We are a micro-enterprise that is just beginning, our Amazon Account as a seller was opened on January 31st. As you may imagine it was a bit of a shock, to say the least when we got an email on February 28th saying our seller account had been suspended.
But shock aside, we do want you to know that even though we might have made mistakes, it isnt and never will be our intention to hurt our mutual customer by delivering subpar or false products.
The root cause that led to the issue
* We listed authentic products but we do not have the documentation asked to demonstrate it.
Actions we took to resolve the issue
* To find another way to document the required information, we double-checked on each brands websites that stores were we shop, are authorized by brands to sell their products. Here we attached screenshots with this information. (We added manually text in blue and highlight in yellow relevant data).
* We asked for an invoice for these products in these stores and they answered that it is no possibility for them to generate an invoice. All three stores said that receipts sent by email, which one we can also check in our history orders, are valid receipts, these mails and orders confirmations are attached to this letter. (We added manually text in blue and highlight in yellow relevant data).
* Due to this background, we prefer dont sell these products, so we created a return order and deleted listings.
Steps we will take to prevent this issue in the future
* For our next purchases, we will be careful to request an invoice.
* We will make a database of suppliers that can give us invoices, the rest will be discarded.
* We will always verify very carefully that the supplier is an authorized seller for the brands of products we will buy.
We are looking forward to your comments, hoping that you consider our case and give us a new opportunity to continue being part of your prestigious company

A few weeks ago, we had one customer that wanted to return a product. In the reason, they stated they saw dirt on the item. For the record, the item was a plush toy, and sealed in a clear plastic bag at the factory and never been opened- unless something happened during shipment. We immediately apologized, asked if they would like a replacement or just wanted a refund, issued a return authorization and even asked if they would be kind enough to send any pictures showing the dirt.
They never responded nor have not returned the product yet.
This morning, I woke up to the listing being removed. This is the only unhappy customer I am aware of and have never heard anything more about the return.
My question is does Amazon really take 1 single complaint and remove the listing because of it? Knowing how many scammers are out there that make up things just to get a product returned without paying for shipping charges and they just select defective, etc- why would they do so? I understand wanting to keep the customer happy and making sure a refund is offered, but if you have sold hundreds if not thousands of units of a product and 1 single person complains about something, you would just remove the listing without an investigation?",Account Health
1446,Help with Amazon ODR Claim Revision,"This is a revision of a claim for high ODR. If there is anything I can improve please let me know.
Dear Seller Performance Team,
I am the manager and am writing in regard to our recent higher than acceptable Order Defect Rate. I understand what happened and take full ownership of our Order Defect Rate being over target. I also will make sure this never happens again by switching completely to FBA.
The root cause of our high ODR was:
Lack of communication, when some customers did not receive their orders and created A-Z Claims and late shipments that were not addressed on time.
I understand that I did not monitor and notice the A-Z claims, I only responded to messages from the Amazon Seller App.
One of the biggest reasons for the delays was we were changing locations because our lease was ending on December 31st. We were not able to send orders on time as we were moving the inventory from one location to the other due to lack of internet and having the system in place.
With everything going on some shipments were delayed and I should have informed customers of delayed orders and to prevent further delays put our account in Vacation mode before moving.
To resolve this situation:
We have contacted everyone and sent out all delayed orders to customers that didnt mind waiting 2-3 more days but wanted their order delivered.
We apologized and applied full refunds to all the orders that were not sent out.
We have identified items that have been problematic in the past and will discontinued selling those items such as syrups in glass bottles.
We have setup all of our computers, printers, internet and all the inventory is neatly organized on shelves at the new location.
To prevent this issue from happening again:
We have converted all of our inventory to Amazon FBA.
We will not be doing any Amazon Merchant Fulfillment.
We will keep additional inventory on hand as a backup for our website but if Amazon is low on stock we can send it out to FBA warehouse in 1-2 days by UPS and reduce lead time.
Next time we move we will put our account in vacation mode until we have everything setup at the new location.
I will diligently check emails & messages three times everyday 9am - 6pm and make sure all customer questions, messages and claims are answered promptly.
My sincerest apologies go to Amazon and the few customers that were affected. I am looking forward to improving my ODR and making sure every customer is treated with the highest level of care. I will strive to provide amazing service and am excited to be finally switching fully to FBA.
Sincerely,
Alex",Account Health

1448,Seller Account deactivated shortly after being verified due to related account,"Hello,
I would like to ask for guidance please in the hope of rectifying my situation. My timeline is as follows:
May 11th:
My Companys Professional FBA seller account was successfully verified at Amazon.com / US. Congratulations to me.
May 12th:
I received an email from Amazon.com to Add a mobile number to complete my account. I provided a mobile phone number that 1) had been used by my Company for another application that is suspended and could not be verified due to mismatch in address and 2) is associated to a personal amazon shoppers account other than myself.
Morning of May 13th (Hong Kong time):
I received the following message:
""You are receiving this e-mail because you recently applied to sell on Amazon or you recently changed information on your seller account.
If you recently applied to sell on Amazon: At this moment, we are not able to verify your account, so your account cannot be activated. Please follow the steps under How do I proceed with my application or reactivate my account?
If you currently sell on Amazon: For your security, we have suspended your Amazon seller account. We need to verify a change to your payment methods. If you did not make this change, contact Seller Support. During our review, you will not be able to sell on Amazon. Please ship any open orders. If you have any funds in your account, they will be available after any amounts paid for A-to-Z claims or chargebacks on your orders have been deducted. This usually takes about 90 days, but funds may be held longer.
How do I proceed with my application or reactivate my account?
To sell on Amazon, we need to verify your identity, business information, or both. You can confirm that you would like to begin the verification process in the following way:
1. Confirm you have a valid credit card on file.
2. Click the Appeal button next to this e-mail on the Notifications page in the Performance section of Seller Central (https://sellercentral-europe.amazon.com/gp/customer-experience/perf-notifications.html).""
I appealed, explaining to them that my credit card info is valid and already verified by Amazon.com/US, even attaching my banks official reference letter given that a monthly bank statement is not yet available for such newly opened bank account.
In less than 1 hour, my seller account is deactivated with the following message from Amazon.com / US:
""Your Amazon.com Seller account has been deactivated in accordance with section 3 of Amazons Business Solutions Agreement. Your listings have been disabled.

Noon of May 13th:
I appealed, explaining that I do NOT own a separate account and do NOT intend to open a separate account in the future.
Evening of May 13th:
I receive the following message from Amazon UK, which sounds like an ultimatum.
""We were unable to verify the information you provided when registering for a Selling on Amazon payment account and, as a result, your Selling on Amazon payment account could not be opened. Unfortunately, this means that you will not be able to continue to sell on Amazon.
Please take appropriate steps to resolve any open orders. Note that any amounts paid as a result of A-to-z Guarantee claims and chargebacks may be deducted from the balance in your existing Seller Account. ""
Please, I request that you enlighten me:
With ""related account"" was Amazon referring to A) the previous application that they had declined or B) the same verified account that I am trying to access the UK Market with?
If the answer to #1 is ""A"" does that mean that the association is being triggered by 1) the common Company Name (i.e. my registered Business Name) and 2) the common mobile phone number?
If the answer to #2 is Yes, then am I better off just getting a new mobile phone number and incorporating a new company for the purpose of initiating a new application that is NOT associated with another account instead of waiting for Amazons resolution (I know they can take up to 90 days and will not identify the reason for their actions)?
I am assuming Amazon would not decline my future application based on association of my Personal Legal name (as beneficiary) with the old applications. Otherwise, that would be completely unreasonable.
Could you please give me some advise on what to do? As above, I am just thinking of just restarting the whole process, making sure I get a new phone number, incorporate a new company, and opt out of selling in other markets. It will be costly but at least I will not have to wait only to find out my current application is irreparable.",Account Health
1449,Selling privileges removed notification - but still selling?,"I received the following email:
Your Amazon.com selling privileges have been removed
Hello,
We are contacting you because you appear to have violated the following policies on Amazon.com :
 Misuse of Ratings, Feedback, or Reviews
 Misuse of Sales Rank
 Misuse of Search and Browse
Prohibited behaviors on Amazon.com include, but are not limited to:
 Hiring 3rd parties to try to improve ASIN rank and/or reviews
 Sending packages to addresses where the recipient does not order or expect them
 Soliciting or accepting false or fraudulent orders
 Placing orders for your own products
 Compensating buyers for purchasing your products (including claim codes)
If this continues, you will not be able to sell on Amazon.com. Learn more about this policy in Seller Central Help https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/200386250.
I cant imagine anything I have done that would fall under the 3 points raised above. The further 5 points appear to be simple reminders of policy and dont imply I would have fallen foul of one of them, but I realised a couple of nights ago when a buyer said his item did not arrive, I accidentally sent the tracking details and confirmed the address of someone elses order by mistake, before following up that a minute or two later with an apology and a full refund, no questions asked, since I felt I had blown my chance to prove delivery with any credibility.
More importantly, I still have my selling privileges so this email appears to be either a mistake, or a warning based on something vague I may have done. Ive also read stories of this email going out in error to sellers in the past, which was intended as a reminder to follow policies rather than a warning.
Could it be my mistake confirming the wrong address with a buyer above? It could be considered an inapproriate message or not providing accurate information, as stated in the policies? Foolishly misusing another customers details?

1454,Problem with account and Amazon not helping,"My account is very messed up and I cant get help. First, the money owed me for nearly four weeks of sales has not been disbursed, tho I have inquired. They say its an unavailable balance but dont explain why, since my account has been impeccable. Second, they have not listed under Manage Orders any sales since April 28, though I have had dozens.
I am posting the reply (same one I got 3 times.) None of the circumstances in the answer (c. f. faster shipping) apply to me. I have a superior record with Amazon and have no issues. I understand their policy fully, but it doesnt fit my circumstances. Here is what they said:
Hello from Amazon Selling Partner Support,
I understand your concern is regarding the disbursement issue.
Upon researching , I found that the payments was held as unavailable balance. This amount currently is being kept as reserve for covering potential guarantee claim, chargebacks and so on. This is known as Unavailable balance.
Please accept my apologies for the inconvenience caused to you due to this.
Please note that payments are transferred to your account based on your Payment Plan and Reserve Period.
To ensure a safe and secure experience for buyers and sellers, we may hold money from an order as a reserve until we know the buyer received the item they ordered in the condition promised. Once you build a history of delivering an excellent buyer-seller experience, we will re-evaluate the time period of the length of your reserve.
Your funds will be placed in reserve for up to 7 days after the delivery date. Once your funds become available balance on your Payments report, Amazon will initiate transfer of these funds to your bank account on the subsequent settlement date.
The Estimated Delivery Date (EDD) is a combination of your handling time and estimated shipping transit times in business days. The estimated transit times are based on carrier shipping speeds. While some sellers perform better than this, we need to make sure that buyers expectations are set appropriately so that they have confidence their packages will arrive by a specific date [(especially during the holidays)].
The EDD for your products will be sooner if you reduce your handling time or offer faster shipping options.
Learn more about shipping options:
http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=1161252&referral=A1I8U2PHYFK51J_A3DR360G2F6GH&referral=A2MUS2D7JXVCNC_A1W1EFMUYK6U65&referral=A1CY6RUX78NW4U_A1W1EFMUYK6U65&referral=A22EN5ECNAQ6GZ_A1W1EFMUYK6U65&referral=A3RT5YVNDU3I6L_A3EK7V0P7TKQAM
In cases where a delivery date is unavailable, this will apply until seven days after the last day of your estimated delivery window. The money from that order will then be transferred to you on your next payment date, as long as you have a positive account balance and no other reserves apply.
The unavailable balance is the amount of funds Amazon holds in your seller account to cover pending chargebacks, refunds, A-to-z Guarantee claims, or reserves associated with your payment policy. Right now, I can see that you have an unavailable balance due to a reserve.
Your reserve period is 7 days, and it is based on your orders. The money you make from a sale will be held in your account for 7 days after your estimated delivery date. On the 8th day, your money will be made available to you. At that point, you can wait for the end of your settlement period, at which time you will be paid for the order automatically, or you can choose to initiate a payment yourself if you want to get your money faster. Just click the Request Transfer button in your Payments Report.
You can access detailed information about an unavailable balance on your account by following these quick steps:
In the Reports section of Seller Central, select Payments.
In the Closing Balance section of the Payments page, click on View Reason next to the Unavailable balance amount.
Please see the Unavailable Balance Help page for more information:
I did what they suggested. First the reserve period hasnt changed in 3 weeks (they say 7 days). Second, the unavailable balance info just says its being held for the reserve period (catch 22). I have no chargebacks or any other problems. Third, they have stopped listing my sales (none listed after April 28), though I have made dozens of sales between April 28 and May 8.

1459,3 asin suspend help me,"Dear Forum Members,
I was suspended in January 2019 . I succeeded to take my money back. But my account is still suspended. First I wanna start to say that I was doing a dropshopping on amazon. canada but at the request of my one of customers, he wanted to buy a Camera from my store on Amazon. com . I hadnt listed any products on amazon . com before. I listed only products my customer wanted on Amazon . com . Unfortunately My account was suspended because of sell to this customer. My costumer I think that he was like a hacker. Because he ordered products from different accounts and he wanted to different addresses in Indonesia.
I send my last appeal yesterday. I wrote this appeal; can I learn your thoughts about appeal thank you.
my appeal;
What went wrong?
 We listed products for the first time on Amazon.com . Because one of the our buyers wanted to buy XIAOMI Camera products from us and he wanted from this camera from Amazon.com marketplace. But we didnt sell before on Amazon.com . We were a seller of Amazon. Ca
 We believed and didnt suspect about this buyer when buyer wanted to change delivery addresses and ordered with different names. Buyer ordered 3 different kind of YI Camera for different addresses with 3 different names (ASIN: B01CW4AZ4M , B01FU6KDEG , B075JFSZM9)
** We were doing a dropshipping that we took products from amazon.com then we sell on Amazon.ca . We retained products invoices when buyer ordered products. **
 We had only an invoice of B01FU6KDEG because we didnt sell other ASINs(B01FU9ZIMU, B01CW4EYIK)
 We didnt control this products before listing in our inventory whether they comply with Intellectual Property Rights Policies of Amazon or not.
 We accept all responsibility for non-compliance with Amazons Policies
What we have done to fix the problems?
** We take full responsibility that all of the products we listed through Amazon comply with all policies. Therefore, we have removed and deleted from our inventory all products that dontfulfill and comply all requirements of Amazons Intellectual Property Policies . **
 We took all receipts of products that we delivered from Amazon.com to prove all products were authentic and bought from reliable sellers.
** We communicated with all buyers and asked them  did you have any negative thoughts about products? Until now , we havent taken any negative answer. **
 We take full responsibility that all of the products we list through Amazon comply with all policies.
 We have controlled trademarks of all products from USPTO, WIPO and TESS. We have taken a new software (SELLER RUNNING) for trademark control to ensure and comply with Amazon trademark policies.
 We have retained the services of American Attorney who has provided us an enviroment of interoperability. So, our sales team has taken a big support and has developed a proactive approach with international cooperation to prevent trademark and intellectual property rights infringement in which our primary objctive is to fulfill compliance with all applicable international laws, policies, trademarks and copyrights.
 Our sales team has developed a international-oriented approach to working and finding official manufacturers and distributors. Because our primary aim is to ensure to deliver authentic products to our customers according to Amazon policies.
What we have done to prevent this error from happening in future?
** We have developed an Amazon Policies Training Program for once in 3 months in classroom. All employees are required to complete training and take continuing education once in 3 months. **
** We have established a product control team exclusively on supervising and verifying compliance of all of our products with all applicable Amazon Policies and International IP Rights. We have created an Independent Quality Assuarence Department to audit all departments. **
** We have implemented a new company policy whereby the process of listing products will begin only after the product team approval. **
 We have initiated product research into the compliance of status of Amazon Policies with wholesalers of North America.

Total Sales in previous 365 days : x

Contact Name: xxx
Contact Phone xxx
POA
Root Cause
We failed to provide information which would inform a buyer that is not familiar with the P1x about how it should appear when brand new.
Product description does not adequately describe what this looks like when brand new.
Buyer with order 112-xxxx purchased two disc golf discs and wrote a message: This disc look used. It is scratched up badly and dirty.;
We are certain that this complaint is in regard to the X-line P1x and NOT about the S-Line TDx. The X-line plastic normally has a scratchy/mottled look when brand new from the manufacturer as this disc is made from a very soft plastic with a flat sheen which causes this scratchy appearance when viewed with differing light angles. A user with any experience with this disc knows this and after one throw of the disc, it is readily apparent to all users what the disc looks like when it is actually used; this was not it. The description of dirty is a misunderstanding or exaggeration of the normal mottled appearance.
Corrective actions taken in regards to this order
We messaged the buyer 3 times, but have not received a reply back, a return request, or feedback.
First message was an apology with an explanation of how the P1x normally looks and an offer for a return/refund
Second message was a standard customer service inquiry asking if he had any problems.
Third message was directly asking if we answered his concerns to his satisfaction regarding this disc and asking if there is anything we misunderstood that we needed to correct
In addition, I reviewed these 2 items in our inventory (no issues found) and spoke to our staff to see if there was anything I was missing.
Preventative measures
I submitted description updates for all x-line plastic discs on Amazon which states :
Note: Because this plastic is very soft, surface is scratchy when brand new.
After this issue, we created an informational slip about this product to explain how it looks to avoid this type of confusion in the future. This is included when this plastic type is shipped.
These products are brand new and serialized by us with a unique photo taken when we receive them into inventory. We are able to identify the exact invoice and receiving date of each individual disc we sell.
All discs from all brands have no product packaging. This is normal for disc golf discs.
We pack discs in a carded/padded #4 envelope with a plastic bubble protective liner. This is superior to the packaging which Amazon uses for similar products as it is stiffer, more padded and not prone to snagging.
Accuracy and quality is checked at 4 points by different people at each stage.
1) Inventory receiving
2) Photo taken of individual item
3) Inventory pulling
4) Inventory packing.
While we may only ship a few of a given ASIN variation (and we take any issue very seriously), it is important to note that we have shipped over 30,000 discs in 2020 and this is an aberration.",Account Health
1461,Help with thisFair Market Pricing email I got,"This past Saturday I received the email listed below. It was for some (less than 10 units) N95 masks that I sold back in early February. At the time I got a lead on selling some of these masks and I decided to sell a few units to experiment with them. Even though they sold quickly I thought better of it and decided to stay away from selling masks or any other health related items during the pandemic.
The email insinuates that failure to respond to the appeal may lead to bigger consequences. The thing is though, I have zero desire to continue selling masks or any other health, cleaning, etc products on Amazon. I would rather let it be and continue selling other, less controversial products. So any advice on what to do here would be appreciated. Should I do a POA for this product even though I no longer want to sell it? Should I just leave it alone? Not sure what to do here.

1465,Feedback Requested on Appeal,"This is an appeal I have put together after multiple rejections and feedback from Amazon Seller Forums. I requested a call from Amazon Seller Support multiple times, but each time I have received the canned response of, We do not have enough information to reinstate your account.
Below is the latest Plan of Action that was also rejected. Im seeking feedback on where to go from here.
THE ROOT CAUSE
The root cause of the late shipment rate exceeding 4% is my failing to pack and ship 31 orders between January 10 and January 20, 2020.
During this time, I did not check Seller Central. I was returning to work from Maternity Leave and had a modified day-to-day operational flow at the physical storefront during this transition. I neglected my obligations to the Amazon Store.
I understand that the Late Shipment Rate refers to two parts: shipping and confirming. My Late Shipment Rate ran high because of late shipping. I have always used Amazon Shipping, therefore shipping confirmations have always been done automatically and are not part of this issue.
WHAT I DID TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE
On January 20, 2020, I transitioned back into my regular day-to-day operations, which includes monitoring the Amazon Store daily. I realized I made a big mistake in neglecting it previously, so I worked quickly to resolve the issues at hand.
I fulfilled all orders (current and late) in two days. I purchased all shipping from Amazon so that the orders are automatically confirmed and my customers automatically receive an email stating that their orders have shipped.
I read and responded to all customer messages. All the messages were resolved by cancelling the order at their request or sending the shipping confirmation provided by Amazon.
I tracked all shipments to ensure they were properly tracking. Every single one of the shipments, including the late ones, were delivered to the customers by the Amazon-prescribed Delivery By dates.
WHAT I WILL DO TO PREVENT THIS ISSUE IN THE FUTURE
I will check Seller Central daily. I will always include managing my Amazon Store in my day-to-day operation.
I will fulfill orders daily.
I will continue to purchase shipping from Amazon so that my orders are automatically confirmed and my customers are kept up to date.
When I am unable to devote the time necessary to operate my Amazon Store, I will send my inventory to be Fulfilled by Amazon.
Please note that Late Shipping has not been an issue with my Amazon Store in the past. It was an isolated incident that took place from January 10 to January 20, in a period of transition. By taking the steps listed above, I am confident that I will not have any more orders shipped late.",Account Health
1466,Listing removed Need Help with POA,"Hello all,
This is a first for me. I had a buyer send a message that the item they received was opened and looked used. They requested a return but never actually returned the item. They also never left any kind of Negative feedback. This item is a simple gasket a filter for a stove top espresso machine and it comes factory sealed in a blister pack.We are authorized resellers for the brand.We ship them in a small bubble envelope so Im assuming it got damaged in transit and this is what caused the buyer message.Amazon pulled the listing because of that message and requires a POA to re-list the item.
I went ahead and sent them all invoices for the past year and tried to explain the whole ordeal the best i could and even stated we will no longer ship in an envelope but will ship in a box in the future. Amazon rejected the POA. I do not know exactly what they want me to explain as I could not even think of anything else I could possibly say!Does anyone have any experience with this and possible help me with what Amazon actually wants to hear we say. It is not an important listing and we do not mind if it is removed but I want to make things right if possible but am kind of lost here.

1469,How do you think my appel for 3 asin inauthentic product,"Dear Amazon Performance Team,
We are writing this objection to address Amazons concerns about the authenticity of the 3 products listed in our inventory.
The reason we upload the products we do not approve the sale to our inventory:
The products that we have not approved for sale due to software problems in the inventory loading and editing software that we started to use recently have been uploaded to our inventory. In addition, we could not notice this situation, as our staff responsible for inventory planning did not perform the necessary checks on time. We dont have invoices for these products because these are not the products we plan to sell. WE NEVER SOLDED THIS PRODUCTS. We would also like to point out that we supply all of our products from Amazon vendors and we know that counterfeit products will not be sold on Amazon. Therefore, the 3 products mentioned can never be fake. Nevertheless, it is definitely our fault to upload the products that we do not approve the sale. We accept full responsibility.
What we did to solve this problem:
Immediately after realizing this situation;
We identified products that we did not approve the sale and these products have been removed from our inventory.
We disabled the software and our store.
We contacted product brands and we apologized them and we asked for a letter stating that they accepted our apology.Only one brand is back and they said they accepted our apology. (We added this e-mail as a file.)
The steps we took to prevent this from happening again:
We had a meeting with our software company and asked them to solve all problems in inventory planning and editing software.
In addition, we have provided our employees with a detailed training on how to use the software effectively and correctly.
We have established a separate department for the quality control of the products we have listed and have appointed a sufficient number of personnel. These personnel will examine all products in detail according to our quality control standards and products that are not approved will never be uploaded to our inventory.
In order to prevent the products that we have not approved for sale from reloading in our inventory, the products to be uploaded to the inventory will have to undergo 3-stage personnel control after being checked by a software.
All the products we will upload to our inventory will be correctly identified on Amazon and customers will be informed in detail. In addition, all our products will be in its original packaging specified on Amazon.
We talked with our suppliers on Amazon and asked for additional documents to prove the authenticity of the products they send to us from now on.
-Our company policy will be revised according to Amazons policies specified;
Amazon anti-counterfeit policy.
Amazon intellectual property policy.
Amazon seller code of conduct.

We hope we can resolved your concerns. If you need additional information, please let us know",Account Health
1470,Account Suspended,"I have uploaded a photo of why my seller central account was deactivated. I am planning out my plan of action, but I want to be able to clearly state why my account was suspended so I can tell them why it wont happen again. First, let me explain what happened. Due to Coronavirus, many items are restricted as to the quantity you can send in at a time. Therefore, I was looking at a specific ASIN, and I created a listing to see if it could even be sent in. It was letting me send it in, but I decided to pass up on the item and just move on. I forgot about it, but then I received this email saying my account was deactivated for even creating this listing. I imagine in my plan of action I need to state reasons as to how I will avoid brands I cannot sell. My question to the community is how do I do that? I was ungated for this brand so I couldnt use the fact that I was gated to know to avoid this product. Please help inform me so I can properly follow the policies Amazon has set in front of me.

Im at my wits end trying to get eligible negative feedback removed without our appeals getting auto-denied. What is the point of even allowing us the ability to appeal a decision if Amazons just going to kick this up to another bot?
This particular review contains unquestionable profane language, which should be eligible for removal per Amazons own policy. Shouldnt their bots be crawling for words like this, anyway? The case is closed immediately without the option to reopen, and any attempt to troubleshoot feedback issues outside of the feedback management system is always met with the same generic template response from CS.
In this case, what can we conceivably do? Its completely left up to chance whether our cases are ever reviewed by a real person.",Account Health
1472,Account suspended due to inauthentic item,"Hi my account was deactivated due to rejected POA. Below is the appeal i sent when i was asked for deeper explanation it was still rejected i thought i had covered every part. can anyone look at it and give some pointers please?
Dear Amazon,
I have received complaints about authenticity of these products and about listings that require approval on seller central. I acknowledge that I have made mistakes and violated amazon policies and have negatively affected Amazon customers. I realize that selling products that are authentic and acquiring amazons approval is important and Therefore, I take full responsibility for the above-mentioned breach of policies. I also apologize, sincerely, for the harm done to the Amazon
A: Causes of the issue:
1a. Checking on ASINs and going through customers feedbacks I can see that I did not purchase these products from authorized distributors who did not provide authorization letters to prove the authenticity of their sources. Even though these products looked identical to the manufacture ones, they lacked the speed, performance, and stability that real items offer. Most of customers complaints were about speed and the malfunctions after reaching a certain capacity in storage which would had not existed if they were authentic. These are mainly due to the fact that the parts used in production of these items were inauthentic, so even though the exterior shell looked real the insides were not. I found these distributors online and was unaware that they were selling faulty and inauthentic items. Even though they assured me that these products were real I did not do my own testing to verify. It was afterwards with customers complaints and later with my own testing that I found that these items were inauthentic. I acquired these products via retail sources rather than directly from brand manufacturers or authorized distributors. I did not follow up with the brands to secure authorization to resell these items on Amazon. I did not verify via Amazon Seller Central that I had approval to offer these products on Amazon or that I had been pre-approved to do so. I relied only on Amazon seller app to determine eligibility. Above issues and not being up to date with amazon polices regarding listing restrictions led to unauthorized and inauthentic products being listed on amazon for sale.
B: Actions taken to fix the problem:
I removed ASINs from amazon (customers were issued returns and refunds). Some customers were compensated additional monetary credit on top of the full refund.
I permanently deleted these ASIN from inventory and they will never be sold again.
I have stopped sourcing my inventory from unauthorized wholesalers
where these products came from, since I received the suspension notification.
I have checked all my inventory and test every products speed, performance and stability to make sure that it matches the manufacturers.
I have checked packaging and made sure all the products were in the manufactures original boxes and I discarded any that were in generic packages.
I double checked my inventory for labels, UPC numbers to make sure to it meets standards, any items that did not have the correct labels were removed.
I revised listings to make sure that they are accurate with product information, images and customers are aware of everything.
I checked to see if product and packages matches the listing, description and images.
I have added more information to product page and in the stores Q&A page to lessen buyers confusion.
I have checked storage environment and shipping procedures for anything that can cause damage to products.
I have revisited manufacture websites for updated information and images to help me spot inauthentic products.
I have contacted manufactures to check the authenticity of my inventory and asked them to verify the validity of my customers concerns.
C: Actions taken to prevent this type of issue in future:
I will ensure a valid supply chain and respect amazon seller
guidelines and policies.
I will source my inventory from authorized wholesale suppliers and obtaining authorization from the brand owners for all items I list on Amazon
I will ask suppliers for invoice and receipts and any other documents
I will ask distributers to submit verification that they are authorized to sell items
I will ask the suppliers for their company registration numbers and EIN and verify them with the National Corporation Directory
I will make sure that each product traces back to its source
I will work closely with seller central and look for customers feedback to ensure future problems do not occur.
I will not rely on the seller app to determine if you are authorized to sell the brand item.
I will only buy from the manufacturer or one of their authorized distributors and have their permission to sell their stuff on Amazon.
I will follow up with brands for authorization to resell their items on amazon.
I will check with amazon seller central for approval before listing any product.
I will keep all documents, invoices, and receipts and scan them for future verification
I will include a message with every purchase instruction the buyer to look at Q&A page and to contact my store directly through amazon for any question to reduce confusion for buyers.
I will ask the distributers and manufactures to consistently send me product updates on a very short interval. This way I can closely monitor any changes to the products and update the listings.
If by a very rare chance a change is made before I receive an update, I will immediately deactivate the listing and update its information and inform the pending orders and take any necessary actions desired by the customer.
I will inspect each shipment to make sure that the product meets the manufactures guidelines in terms of packaging, size, color etc.
I will ask suppliers to send photo verification of each inventory before shipment. If the product is different in any way from the original, I will not purchase.
I will enter into a contractual agreement with trusted sellers to purchase from them on continually basis and/or buy in very large quantity at once so I can ensure the quality of the products remains the same.
I will store every product in proper conditions to ensure that it retain its original condition and lessen any damage to the packaging.
Products will be accurately described on amazon with more product information and images to less buyers ambiguity regarding purchase. Buyers will be well informed on every purchase.
I will ensure that shipping procedure meet Amazons standards to minimize damage to product and packaging.
I will do extensive testing on each product regardless of its source before listing on amazon.
Box will be inspected at least twice before sealing and labeling to ensure damage-free before shipping.
Use adapted size box as possible and bubble wrap to fulfill empty space, keep the box content compact and avoid packages and items collision.
I will constantly check with amazon for any updates on brands that require authorization or any changes in the listing polices.
Any products that do not meet Amazons and above standards will not be listed or purchased.
All the policies above will be documented (paper and electronic format), and all
current employees (myself) and any future recruits will also undergo training.
I hope my changes will be satisfactory with Amazons standards. Thank you, and if you need any more information please contact me.
Regards,
xx

On 4/23:
I submitted the following POA:>
April 23, 2020 7:27 PM EDT
The root cause of the issue
I am fully aware of and have read the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy. The pricing on the following items were raised too high and violated the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy. The price per unit cannot be significantly higher than recent prices offered on or off Amazon .
The following ASINs violated the policy.
ASIN: B07RJ7PCHS
ASIN: B07RJ7KTB7
ASIN: B00T411T7E
ASIN: B06WGL8F44
ASIN: B00VHJX9WE
ASIN: B00UATIX0U
ASIN: B07BBRH5YT
The prices were raised due to the increased cost of sourcing and obtaining the items in question and the increased cost of shipping to the customer.
The actions you have taken to resolve the issue
Upon realizing this issue,
I lowered the price of the items to their original price. I read the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy again, along with the Product Detail Page Rules.
The items that were no longer in stock, listings have been either removed or deleted.
I have checked the remainder of my inventory to ensure all items are in compliance. Moving forward, I will continually monitor my prices to ensure they follow the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy.
The steps you have taken to prevent the issue going forward
To prevent this from happening again, We have implemented a checks-and-balance system, where two employees have to verify that the prices charged follows all of Amazon pricing policy.
in order to put these checks into practice we purchased a subscription to a service that allow us to verify the price history, so that we do not unfairly price our items.
Lastly, we have invested in repricing software which automatically sets our price and will not allow our price to exceed our specific threshold.
With the improvements mentioned, we feel we have taken steps to ensure that Amazon customers receive the best fair price possible.

So @Arthur_Amazon, when will Amazon vet those that make such complaints?
Why out of all the sellers are we targeted?? Because we have the lowest price?? (Hmm maybe a competitor??)
This company would never complain about our goods since its directly from them.
They would never use a GMAIL Address to harass Amazon sellers
Now we have to spend time defending ourselves to some unknown complainant. Amazon give no details on who they are other than a flimsy email address.

""Your Amazon.com Seller account has been deactivated in accordance with section 3 of Amazons Business Solutions Agreement. Your listings have been disabled.

We found that your account is related to an account that may not be used to sell on our site. As a result, you may no longer sell on Amazon.com.""
I got the same email from the other markets. Additionally Amazon UK charged money from my bank account (but I don not even register there). Or maybe I do by mistake when I clicked Go to another marketplace? I think I opened my account for a global selling and it may couse some issues.
Ive noticed one more thing - I can log in with the same email and password on normal amazon.com and sellercentral site. Is it normal ? Or they are two different platforms for buyers/for sellers? I can login in via the same details on other marketsHow it is possible ? I registered only on US market.

1486,"Appeal Approved, Still Inactive - Malicious Report By Competitor","Hi All,
Ive been targeted by a malicious competitor for the last few weeks. After receiving two false copyright infringement reports (both overturned), several suspicious negative reviews, the latest scam is a product inauthenticity complaint. This is especially silly as its our brand. Were with Brand Registry as Rights Owner.
We were told by Amazon we needed approval to sell our own brand. Our appeal was successful, and the status is approved, but the listing is still inactive. Whenever I open cases, I get generic copy-paste responses telling me to appeal. Is it just a matter of waiting? Its only been a few hours, but Im worried this wont be reactivated. Should I delete and relist the listing, or wait and keep trying to get through to a human at seller support?",Account Health
1487,Pesticide product that isnt,"My product was/is an air filter under the FBA program. Amazon recently stopped allowing them to be sold because it allegedly is a pesticide product. This, of course, is absurd. Every single component of this filter is available in many other air filtration products for sale on Amazon. There are zero pesticides in my air filter.
After a couple weeks of at least a dozen communications with increasingly Byzantine-to-down-right-Kafkaesque back and forth with seller support absolutely zero explanation was offered. I would say it isnt a pesticide product. I would ask them why they think it is a pesticide product. I provided a list of every single component of the product, with the notable absence of pesticides. They would not answer the question and reiterate that it cant be sold because it is a pesticide product.
I was/am not going to give up. I like cracking codes. So I finally figured out I should look up just what Amazon means by Pesticide product. I got a clue. Amazon guidelines contain the paragraph:
In the United States, a broad range of products are subject to regulation as pesticides, including products that you may not immediately think of as pesticides. Any product or device either: (1) intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest, or (2) making any antimicrobial, antifungal, antibacterial, or pesticide claim (each, a Pesticide) must comply with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), including (in most cases) registration with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). For more information, see https:// www. epa. gov/pesticides.
My listing contains the wording Greatly reduces allergens, bacteria, viruses and pet dander in your air. All true. We just love to kill and trap the heck out of some bad microbes and bacteria and viruses using tried and true technology. But again, so do many others.
Insights I am hoping to gain from your responses are: 1. Is there any hope? 2. Should I propose to eliminate that wording even though dozens (thousands?) of other products make similar claims? 3. Is there a way to reach a reasonable human being at Amazon who might see the reasonableness of my request? 4. Is there some form, button, procedure, tactic, method that Amazon makes available to resolve this problem?",Account Health

1489,Incorrectly Received Notification of Restricted Products Removal,"Hello,
I got a Notification of Restricted Products Removal from Amazon today. They deleted 2 of my product detail pages with hundreds of reviews and a great sales ranking. Ive been selling this item for 5 years and have had competitors do things like claim there is no expiration date to have it shut down in the past.
Amazon claims the product contains CBD, THC or Resin. It does not, but customers constantly ask this and I inform them that it does not in the product questions. Those words are nowhere on the product page otherwise and the full ingredient list is on the detail page.
Can someone help me with what I should say to Seller Support? I am sure it will not be as easy as just saying, These products do not contain CBD, THC or Resin.
Also, I thought this issue would be with Seller Performance, but their email says contact Support?
I am also concerned that my product page with all the reviews is now deleted and gone. I now only see the Oops, dog page.

1491,Account deactivated for inauthentic,"Hi, I Need Some Help.
a month ago my account had been deactivated for inauthentic complain.
all my POA keep getting rejected.
I keep on getting a reply to send invoices from 365 days with supplier name address phone number for the items sold. greater details of root cause, action taking and preventing measurement.
any recommendations?
this is my last POA ive send and added receipt from the stores.
Root Cause;
ASIN*** - didnt store in refrigerator area which cause the scent to change
ASIN*** - sell item that inconsistent in the detail page unclear about the size
ASIN*** - didnt refrigerate the perfume which cause the scent change
-poorly stored perfume not in a refrigerate storage up to shipment like recommended for manufacturers.
-poorly stored perfumes not in the right temperature, exposed to sun and heat
-poorly packaged in a single layer envelop, which where black colored that absorb sun and heat.
action taking;
reply to customer with free return and fully refunded the items.
removed and deleted those 3 ASIN from inventory
would no longer sell it any Le Labo perfume.
moved my storage to my basement where theres no windows or sunlight. temperature is below 70 degrees to prevent perfume scent go bad.
provide much thicker bubbled envelopes and wrapping tissue paper to create isolation from sun and heat. and to prevent damage of the product.
will add keep away from heat and ""Fragile stickers on packages.
Review your communications from buyers to better understand the issues.
read through the health pages to review the policy
steps to prevent
will order refrigerate storage for all perfume to make sure refrigerate and kept the scent
will go over inventory and make sure every item that I required refrigerator will be stored correctly
to avoid heat and sunlight mail will be drop daily at 4pm
will no longer sell Le Labo perfume because of the scent evolution and issue it may cause, I completely deleted all Le Labo perfume.
have extensively read and deliberated on Amazon Policies, Guidelines and seller expectations in order to be prepared to fully abide by them in the future.
-I have thoroughly reviewed Amazons selling policies for Authenticity to ensure that I will not make any more mistakes in violating policies. I have already taken down these problematic listings and I have reviewed all my other listings to ensure that I do not violate any other Amazon policies.
I have learnt extensively on proper sourcing, I was not aware that Nordstrom and retails stores does not consider as authorize reseller. going forward I only work with with verified suppliers meaning that I will only purchase from authorized resellers or manufacturers.
I also learned about accurate listing, which means that not only do I describe the product well, but also that the customer understands what they are receiving with the little knowledge they may have about the product.
I have equally read about proper packaging, and the importance of providing the customer with the item exactly as it is in its original packaging. will make sure all products come in original package as describe in amazon site. with all information and parts as describes in Amazon.
ASIN will be checked at least once every 2 weeks to make sure nothing had been change on listing description and that detail page accurately to inventory
I have read about the importance of performing various quality checks, Ill do quality check once every 2 weeks. in order to ensure that the product is store-packed and shipped appropriately.
I have reviewed all communications with buyers in order to better understand all the issues needed to be addressed.
I hereon vow to abide by Amazon policy as long as I sell on Amazon.
This is my plan of action.
Please return my selling privileges so I can continue to work on this platform with newfound devotion to become better seller

1492,"Perfect Metrics, 100% positive feedback.. Suspended for selling too much, havent been paid a DIME since starting to sell since January","So long story short, a day or two before each disbursement we get hit with a velocity review, or random review. We have NEVER gone above 1% for our ODR. We had received one complaint about whether or not we have rights to sell a particular ASIN - which is one of the products we manufacture. And the ASIN lists us as the brand name. Strange huh? We started selling in January of this year on Amazon. We have yet to receive a penny for the products sent.
Now our account is deactivated. Havent gotten a response from seller performance in over a week. Emailed jeff@amazon.com. No response. I messaged some of the Amazon staff here on the forums. No response.
Wondering what exactly going on here?
My evidence is backed with over a dozen documents proving my identity, suppliers, tax information, rights to sell my own products, ect.
Here is my latest Plan of Action I just sent to them, which will likely be ignored like the rest:
Hello,.
I have not heard a response in over a week, which is quite troubling, especially since we have not gotten paid a penny for all the items weve sold and services weve rendered. I hope we can get this resolved. We would love to continue to do business with you, our company is experiencing growth with a launch of a new product line manufactured by us. Its been getting rave reviews from customers, and we would love to add it to the Amazon catalog.
I realize you have some questions about our account and Id be happy to help. Im not sure if you compile my responses and read them all when I add additional information, if thats the case it would explain why the account has not been reactivated as over the coarse of the last 7 replies Ive provided all documentation that was requested.
We have been in business since 2007, selling unique video game controllers and accessories. We sell on eBay where we have 100% positive feedback, and also at our website XXXXXXXXXX. We have been featured in several prominent publications such as the Wall St Journal, Yahoo Finance, Marketwatch, and Bloomberg Businessweek. Here is a link to one of those articles about us, and how we are a mover and shaker in our industry:
XXXXXXXXXX
The original message received from you indicated a review was taking place because my feedback did not support my sales volume, which is completely understandable, with us being a relatively new seller. At the time of the notice from you, we only had 2 feedback count, despite numerous sales. Upon receiving that email, I simply asked buyers if they could leave feedback. Upon doing so, we grew to 12 feedback, which I should mention all of which were positive. I realize on Amazon not many buyers leave feedback, as they do on sites like Amazon. But we did show a substantial increase in feedback to support our sales, the fact that 100% was positive should count for something. In addition to maintaining 100% positive feedback, our ODR has NEVER gone above 1% Again, this should count for something. If we were not an adequate seller, we would not have such good metrics and feedback. Clearly our seller metrics and feedback demonstrate that we are providing not only good service, but good quality products as well. We have barely any returns as well - showing that customers are happy with our products. This should be of value to you, as your reputation also relies on the products offered and services rendered by us. If a buyer receives a poor quality product or poor service, they may be uncertain about buying on Amazon again. If they have a positive experience with great products and service, they will return to the site for the rest of their needs and purchase more items there. This is good business for you, because you will make money based on the fact that we are providing a great experience for our customers so they return to Amazon, not just to buy our products but others as well.
The email asked for some verification and a tax ID. I have a verified tax ID on my account here, the number is XXXXXXXXXX. Ive attached my EIN certificate as well as further proof. On that notice is also my name and address, to which I am providing documentation to prove. Ive attached my passport, a debit card, my bank statement, and a utility bill. The information matches across the board - showing that I am an authentic seller of my products and that I do own the company.
I understand there was concern regarding us listing ASIN XXXXXXXXXX. The fact is, this account on Amazon is a part of the company X, as an outlet store. We are an authorized reseller of X products, X is our parent company, which I also own. Ive attached a letter drafted from my legal team that authorized X DBA Y on Amazon to sell all X products including ASIN XXXXXXXXXX. However, I have a plan to resolve this easier - we will simply not list this item if it raises any questions. Attached is a screenshot to show we have discontinued the listing. I have no problem refraining from selling ASIN XXXXXXXXXX so that we can all rest easy and be assured no violations are taking place.
The email asked for anticipated sales numbers. We can manage our sales volume by limiting product offering and advertising. I know based on our business history, we are fully capable of continuing our growth. Because we are new with Amazon I have been limiting our product offering to align with our business model, while we train all employees on how to use the Amazon platform effectively. Ensuring that all orders are shipped on time, and customer emails are responded to the same business day of receiving them. Several employees are being trained on the platform, so if anything were to happen to me where there was an emergency, the account would not suffer and will continue to thrive without any disruption. Anyway, I would like to start off with $ZZZ in monthly sales if possible. If you have concerns, we are willing to restrict that amount and cap off our sales at a certain level and remove listings and enable vacation mode. We can limit our inventory quantities available on Amazon to restrict sales if needed.
I understand you wish to know my supplier information. Here are 3 of my suppliers, along with their contact information and attached invoices. Feel free to reach out to them to verify this information:
XXXXXXXXXXXX
I did not see this addressed in the emails to us, but I notice in our metrics that there is a strike against us for suspected trademark/IP violations. I understand there may have been misuse of the word Xbox. Ive spoken to my legal team who has informed me that the proper wording is compatible with Xbox, and to rephrase my listings as such. As with the previous ASIN of concern that was mentioned, Ive removed those listings as well, just to play it safe. Attached are screenshots to show theyve been removed, I will not list them again and be mindful when creating any new listings, and have them reviewed by legal prior to posting them, to ensure no IP/trademark violations occur.
I would like to mention we have not been paid for any of our products sold or services rendered, which concerns me. We have tracking to indicate the items were delivered, as well as buyer confirmation in the form of feedback to show the customers have been satisfied. Our compliant ODR also suggests the items were delivered in a proper manner, as described in the listings and in a timely manner. I am hoping we can resolve this account issue and receive our disbursement, and also reactivate our account so we can continue to list on Amazon and grow with you. There is great potential here for both of our companies, and I look forward to seeing what we can accomplish together. I am very happy with the platform you provide and I believe this will be a great 3rd party marketplace for us, as our customers are great matches to your customers. As mentioned before, we can control the velocity in which how fast we grow the company through selling on Amazon, as we do with other sales outlets. By limiting inventory offerings and product offerings to a small number, we can be assured that our current staff can continue to maintain the great level of service we offer without any issues
Our plan is to continue to grow with you, but in a controlled manner, so that we ensure we can allocate resources to continue to provide the level of service we do now. As demonstrated by our feedback and ODR, we are selling top notch products and providing top notch service, which we will continue to do. Most of our staff is trained on the Amazon platform. As we grow on Amazon, I will continue to train more staff on the Amazon platform. I hope that we can shift the majority of our sales to Amazon as it is a great fit for us for the products we sell and the customers you currently have. We will dedicate 100% of our efforts and resources to Amazon. In doing so, we can offer 24/7 support. This ensures buyers in different counties can have questions answered quickly. Our plan is to have all emails answered within one hour of receiving them. We will continue to send all products the same day, or next day after receiving the orders. Currently all orders placed before 3PM are shipped the same day, and orders placed after that go out the next business day, at the latest. This is all in accordance to the specified handling and delivery times in our listings. Our plan outlined above will further improve our customer service as we shift all our sales to Amazon. I look forward to doing so with you, as soon as our account is reactivated we can shut down the sales on other sales outlets and focus cus entirely on Amazon. This is a great opportunity for both of us and the future looks bright!
Thank you,

1493,Restricted Product - Misidentified Product,"On Wednesday May 6th one of our top listings was taken down for being a restricted product Asin: B07G88X4YY - Case ID 6990439511
What was odd was that we didnt get a notification, I just saw that sales stopped and then when I looked it said that it was inactive because it was restricted. It said check your performance notifications to find out why. However, we didnt get a performance notification.
I called seller support and when she looked it said that was identified as a Pulse Oximeter and therefore restricted (it was a fishing neck gaiter that we have sold for over 2 years).
What she found was the someone else had made an offering on our product (we are brand registered) and added new search terms, a new product title, new description all using terms that caused it to be flagged. Despite none of this actually being used by Amazon on the front end, I guess it was enough for the bots to get the product removed. None of this was stuff we could even see either.
I was told by seller support that it was obviously not a pulse oximeter and should be fixed quickly. She said it would be back within 72 hours. I contacted Amazon again as I noticed in the case she only identified one of the variation ASINs and not the parent and seller support again assured me that it would be back within 72 hours.
I contacted Seller Support today after more than 72 hours and now they are saying there is no timetable. This is extremely frustrating because A: I dont know what information to believe B: The only reason I found out that the product was taken down was because sales stopped and had no idea why because I never got a notification. C: It was clearly done by a bad actor to sabotage us (and I found that one of our main competitors had what looks like the same thing happen to them). So it seems like it is something that is being exploited.",Account Health

A few days ago I received a notice from amazon.de, I have pasted the full message below (translated to English as I cant read or speak German).
My questions are:
What do I need to do next? I dont want to appeal, as this was a product I was planning on launching, but clearly its not a good idea, I had no idea this product was EU patented. I should have done more research on the product. No sales occurred in the DE marketplace. A few in the UK and FR.
I dont want the ASIN or listing back as. I wont be selling the item.
What happens if you dont appeal? As I see it the appeal is only if you want to keep the listing, which I dont.
Do I need to contact the rights owner?
and Finally
**There is a line in the message, that says **: If the rights holder does not withdraw his complaint or you do not provide any supporting information, we can forward your contact details to the rights holder on request. Is this upon my request or the rights holder request?
Really appreciate any help or advise, I see a lot of people talking about POA, but forgive me if I am not reading the message properly, or have not interpreted it properly. Is the message asking me to get in contact with Amazon and submit a POA. (My account is still working, and I am still selling my other products)
I want to resolve this ASAP, and I am aware that the account will be annotated and it will stay on record. My main concern is will the account be closed if no action is taken on my part, and if it will, then what steps should I take next?

My POA 
Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team,
Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to appeal my seller accounts suspension for listing restricted products that are prohibited from sale on Amazon.
What went wrong / The Root Cause:
 In fact, I did unknowingly list a restricted product. I believe the error occurred in the information I provided when the listing was completed. Furthermore, Ive come to learn that Targus maybe a product that requires additional authorization to sell on your site
 Unfortunately, I am unable to specifically pinpoint where my error occurred. It was my intention to sell a stylus,
which I do not believe is a restricted product, I can only surmise that the error occurred in the listing information.
that I used.
 I believe it was in the information i provided in the listing, because I was deactivated for the suspicion trying to
sell a red laser pointer. In reality, I was only trying to sell a simple stylus.
 Please note, I was given 48 hours to remove the restricted products. However, at the time, I was given that
opportunity I never realized it. Upon my original account deactivation a few years back, I I was in the hospital and

 At the end of last year, I decided to give selling another shot, I looked into my seller account, and I noticed the
newest performance notifications. After researching the Amazon Seller forums on restricted products, and how
to do plans of appeal, I prepared an appeal to state my case.
What I have done to fix the issue.
 I have carefully reviewed all of Amazons guidelines. Furthermore, to prevent any such violations from occurring in the future, Ive researched information regarding the sale of restricted products, the correct way to aadvertise my products.
 Ive educated myself about the products that are prohibited from sale and cant be listed. This includes your Restricted Products policy, including the Examples of Prohibited Listings section. Though its important to point out Ive never missed it a prohibited item, I have educated myself on what those items are to prevent any problems in the future.
 The final step Ive taken is to remove all of the listings that were in doubt, and being questioned. In the future, I will double check all of my listings to make sure that the products are described accurately, and are fully compliant with the rules that Amazon has set forth.
What I will do to prevent this from happening again:
 i believe the error occurred in the listing. In the future to prevent this from happening, if theres anything that Im not absolutely certain about I will call you guys for a clear explanation.
 Ive educated myself about the products that are prohibited from sale, and cant be listed. This includes your Restricted Products policy, including the Examples of Prohibited Listings section. Though its important to point out Ive never missed it a prohibited item, I have educated myself on what those items are to prevent any problems in the future.
 Before listing any new items on Amazon, I will verify that they are permitted for sale, and compliant with Amazon policies and procedures.
 To help ensure that I do not violate any more policies, I will also research whether all of my products are accurately described, and correctly listed in the most informative way for any potential buyers.
 Weekly Reviews of:
Amazon Policies
Seller Central Updates
Amazon Seller Support Forums
Federal, State, and Local Laws/Regulations
Product Updates and Recalls
 New Listing Method:
The 3 Rs - Reasearch, Reveal, Review , then Post
Research
This step ensures I dont encounter this dilemma again, it will include me ,
Checking into your policies
All Laws and Regulations
Product Updates and Recalls
Reveal
This step is to simply list the item that Im trying to sell. I called reveal because here is where I reveal
everything about the product, such as photos, condition, description etc.
Review
The final step is to review what I am trying to list for sale. At this point, I will review all of my research,
what I am trying to reveal, and ill take this opportunity to give my listing one final look over.
Then, my product will be ready to be successfully listed!
 My weekly reviews, and new listing method should be my safeguard to fix my root cause I the future!
 These corrective actions will ensure I can immediately take action, and proactively remain compliant with my
listings. Any products that I am unable to verify with 100% certainty, will not be listed.
In conclusion , I believe that this plan provides that this issue has been rectified, and itll be prevented from occurring again. I look forward to having my selling privileges restored. I also look forward to hearing from you! Thanks again for your time!
SIncerely,

1497,Why ODR affected while customer withdrew the claim,"An a to z claim received and then withdrawn by the customer. Meanwhile, I refunded the customers amount. Amazon closed the case and counted the claim aginst my ODR. Why my Order Defect Rate increased although customer the customer had withdrawn the claim",Account Health
1498,Sold As New Complaint Question,"Good morning eveyone!
Ive got a quick question for you all to see if anyone has ever come across this before. Yesterday we were contacted by a customer and told an item that we shipped them was used and not new. We dont ever sell used items and the item that the person bought was supposed to be new. We are of course replacing the item with expedited shipping with a NEW replacement while investigating how this could have happened.
Meanwhile this morning I get a performance notification from amazon about the issue and that the items listing has been closed. Totally understandable considering the situation. They have asked for a plan of action to reactivate the listing, which I am in the process of completing.
My question is: The message I received said there would be an affected asin listed in my account performance dashboard. I have looked all over that dashboard including in the product policy compliance section and there is no listed asin there to submit my appeal. There appears to be no evidence of any issues at all in my performance section except for the automated performance notification. The listing has indeed been deactivated, so I do not want to reactivate it without properly taking care of my appeal. Is there another way to submit my information? Or should I open a help ticket asking where to submit my appeal?
Thanks for any advice you all may have to offer.",Account Health
1499,Violation of Fair Pricing - Whats Next?,"HI! I recently had a listing removed and I received a Violation of Amazons Fair Pricing Policy strike.
The item was Scrubbing Bubbles Bathroom Cleaner (I can no longer find it in the Amazon Catalog).
When I listed it I chose match lowest price and was almost immediately given the warning and the listing was pulled. I wanted to stay away from that listing and did not have plans to attempt to relist it.
I definitely should have researched the 90 day average price instead of just going with the lowest price and this is a mistake I will not make again.
My question is - Since I have never received a violation of any kind, I was not aware that Amazon wanted a response to this violation. After 3 days, I dug a little deeper and found where Amazon wanted me to respond. The option I was given was a series of statements that I placed a check mark by, acknowledging the violation and that it will not happen again. That was about 2 weeks ago.
I have not received any e-mails from Amazon, but there is the option to Submit Additional Information IF Amazon requested it (which I dont think they have). Should I submit a POA anyway? Or does this policy strike stay on my account? If so, does anyone know for how long?

As soon as we find out about the lost package we did the right thing and refunded the customer immediately. Amazon says this is a defect that counts against us because the customer had to file a claim. In other words, were supposed to monitor every tracking number for delivery of every package we ship. We are a Mom-and-Pop operation, without resources to do that. The customer was happy because they have sent in another order for the same item. We made Amazon look good, but we lose.

1503,Price Gouging Questions,"Anyone can give a clear definition of price gouging on Amazon in recent chaos? I searched on Amazon. They only give a very vague Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy which is not useful in practice at all.
I want to know specifically that what products are affected and what kind of price increase is permitted(10%? 20%? 30%? comparing with who?).
For example, nintendo switch (ASIN: B01MFADJFV) msrp is $299.99 and everyone is selling it at $500.00.(https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B01MFADJFV/ref=dp_olp_afts?ie=UTF8&condition=all 199) Isnt this considered as Price Gouging?

1505,Brand owner sent a retraction email on claim but complaint is still active,"In January I got what I suspect is a counterfeit claim from a brand (it simply says infringement).

I took no further action thinking it was resolved.
Well, I stumble across it the other day under my Health Account with the Appeal button still there. Wanting to resolve the matter, I basically push the appeal button, explain I am not trying to relist the product, attach the email to the appeal and ask them if this will remove the complaint (my goal). I get the standard letter from Amazon that says the following:
Hello,
Thank you for your message. We cannot accept your appeal because it does not address the report we received from the rights owner. Please provide the following information so we can process your appeal:
 Proof of product authenticity (e.g., invoice, Order ID, licensing agreement, letter of authorization). It must clearly prove that your products do not infringe any intellectual property rights.
Has your listing been deactivated in error?
If you believe there has been an error, please tell us why. Your explanation should include the following information:
 How your listing(s) have not violated the brands intellectual property.
Where do I send this information?
Please submit this information by clicking the Appeal button on Account Health (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/performance/dashboard 1).
What happens if I do not send the requested information?
 If we do not receive the requested information, the listing will remain removed and your account could be deactivated.
Well I want to resolve this matter and get this off my account, but I do not understand why I am being asked to provide this information if the brand owner retracted the complaint.
What should I do in this situation??? Do I just address this matter as if they never got the letter because Amazon wants me to provide a POA or do I need to get them to pay attention to the retraction letter?",Account Health

1507,"Havent been paid a DIME since I started selling 5 months ago.. 100% positive FB, ODR <1% ALWAYS, Random velocity reviews","So long story short, a day or two before each disbursement we get hit with a velocity review, or random review. We have NEVER gone above 1% for our ODR. We had received one complaint about whether or not we have rights to sell a particular ASIN - which is one of the products we manufacture. And the ASIN lists us as the brand name. Strange huh? We started selling in January of this year on Amazon. We have yet to receive a penny for the products sent.
Now our account is deactivated. Havent gotten a response from seller performance in over a week. Emailed jeff@amazon.com. No response. I messaged some of the Amazon staff here on the forums. No response.
Wondering what exactly going on here?
My evidence is backed with over a dozen documents proving my identity, suppliers, tax information, rights to sell my own products, ect.
Here is my latest Plan of Action I just sent to them, which will likely be ignored like the rest:
Hello,.
I have not heard a response in over a week, which is quite troubling, especially since we have not gotten paid a penny for all the items weve sold and services weve rendered. I hope we can get this resolved. We would love to continue to do business with you, our company is experiencing growth with a launch of a new product line manufactured by us. Its been getting rave reviews from customers, and we would love to add it to the Amazon catalog.
I realize you have some questions about our account and Id be happy to help. Im not sure if you compile my responses and read them all when I add additional information, if thats the case it would explain why the account has not been reactivated as over the coarse of the last 7 replies Ive provided all documentation that was requested.
We have been in business since 2007, selling unique video game controllers and accessories. We sell on eBay where we have 100% positive feedback, and also at our website XXXXXXXXXX. We have been featured in several prominent publications such as the Wall St Journal, Yahoo Finance, Marketwatch, and Bloomberg Businessweek. Here is a link to one of those articles about us, and how we are a mover and shaker in our industry:
XXXXXXXXXX
The original message received from you indicated a review was taking place because my feedback did not support my sales volume, which is completely understandable, with us being a relatively new seller. At the time of the notice from you, we only had 2 feedback count, despite numerous sales. Upon receiving that email, I simply asked buyers if they could leave feedback. Upon doing so, we grew to 12 feedback, which I should mention all of which were positive. I realize on Amazon not many buyers leave feedback, as they do on sites like Amazon. But we did show a substantial increase in feedback to support our sales, the fact that 100% was positive should count for something. In addition to maintaining 100% positive feedback, our ODR has NEVER gone above 1% Again, this should count for something. If we were not an adequate seller, we would not have such good metrics and feedback. Clearly our seller metrics and feedback demonstrate that we are providing not only good service, but good quality products as well. We have barely any returns as well - showing that customers are happy with our products. This should be of value to you, as your reputation also relies on the products offered and services rendered by us. If a buyer receives a poor quality product or poor service, they may be uncertain about buying on Amazon again. If they have a positive experience with great products and service, they will return to the site for the rest of their needs and purchase more items there. This is good business for you, because you will make money based on the fact that we are providing a great experience for our customers so they return to Amazon, not just to buy our products but others as well.
The email asked for some verification and a tax ID. I have a verified tax ID on my account here, the number is XXXXXXXXXX. Ive attached my EIN certificate as well as further proof. On that notice is also my name and address, to which I am providing documentation to prove. Ive attached my passport, a debit card, my bank statement, and a utility bill. The information matches across the board - showing that I am an authentic seller of my products and that I do own the company.
I understand there was concern regarding us listing ASIN XXXXXXXXXX. The fact is, this account on Amazon is a part of the company X, as an outlet store. We are an authorized reseller of X products, X is our parent company, which I also own. Ive attached a letter drafted from my legal team that authorized X DBA Y on Amazon to sell all X products including ASIN XXXXXXXXXX. However, I have a plan to resolve this easier - we will simply not list this item if it raises any questions. Attached is a screenshot to show we have discontinued the listing. I have no problem refraining from selling ASIN XXXXXXXXXX so that we can all rest easy and be assured no violations are taking place.
The email asked for anticipated sales numbers. We can manage our sales volume by limiting product offering and advertising. I know based on our business history, we are fully capable of continuing our growth. Because we are new with Amazon I have been limiting our product offering to align with our business model, while we train all employees on how to use the Amazon platform effectively. Ensuring that all orders are shipped on time, and customer emails are responded to the same business day of receiving them. Several employees are being trained on the platform, so if anything were to happen to me where there was an emergency, the account would not suffer and will continue to thrive without any disruption. Anyway, I would like to start off with $ZZZ in monthly sales if possible. If you have concerns, we are willing to restrict that amount and cap off our sales at a certain level and remove listings and enable vacation mode. We can limit our inventory quantities available on Amazon to restrict sales if needed.
I understand you wish to know my supplier information. Here are 3 of my suppliers, along with their contact information and attached invoices. Feel free to reach out to them to verify this information:
XXXXXXXXXXXX
I did not see this addressed in the emails to us, but I notice in our metrics that there is a strike against us for suspected trademark/IP violations. I understand there may have been misuse of the word Xbox. Ive spoken to my legal team who has informed me that the proper wording is compatible with Xbox, and to rephrase my listings as such. As with the previous ASIN of concern that was mentioned, Ive removed those listings as well, just to play it safe. Attached are screenshots to show theyve been removed, I will not list them again and be mindful when creating any new listings, and have them reviewed by legal prior to posting them, to ensure no IP/trademark violations occur.
I would like to mention we have not been paid for any of our products sold or services rendered, which concerns me. We have tracking to indicate the items were delivered, as well as buyer confirmation in the form of feedback to show the customers have been satisfied. Our compliant ODR also suggests the items were delivered in a proper manner, as described in the listings and in a timely manner. I am hoping we can resolve this account issue and receive our disbursement, and also reactivate our account so we can continue to list on Amazon and grow with you. There is great potential here for both of our companies, and I look forward to seeing what we can accomplish together. I am very happy with the platform you provide and I believe this will be a great 3rd party marketplace for us, as our customers are great matches to your customers. As mentioned before, we can control the velocity in which how fast we grow the company through selling on Amazon, as we do with other sales outlets. By limiting inventory offerings and product offerings to a small number, we can be assured that our current staff can continue to maintain the great level of service we offer without any issues
Our plan is to continue to grow with you, but in a controlled manner, so that we ensure we can allocate resources to continue to provide the level of service we do now. As demonstrated by our feedback and ODR, we are selling top notch products and providing top notch service, which we will continue to do. Most of our staff is trained on the Amazon platform. As we grow on Amazon, I will continue to train more staff on the Amazon platform. I hope that we can shift the majority of our sales to Amazon as it is a great fit for us for the products we sell and the customers you currently have. We will dedicate 100% of our efforts and resources to Amazon. In doing so, we can offer 24/7 support. This ensures buyers in different counties can have questions answered quickly. Our plan is to have all emails answered within one hour of receiving them. We will continue to send all products the same day, or next day after receiving the orders. Currently all orders placed before 3PM are shipped the same day, and orders placed after that go out the next business day, at the latest. This is all in accordance to the specified handling and delivery times in our listings. Our plan outlined above will further improve our customer service as we shift all our sales to Amazon. I look forward to doing so with you, as soon as our account is reactivated we can shut down the sales on other sales outlets and focus cus entirely on Amazon. This is a great opportunity for both of us and the future looks bright!

1508,Enough of Holding Money of Sellers and not Helping Them!,"Amazon is holding my money which is $230.000. I have tried everything to appeal and talk ti them even working with Thompson but cant get it activated. I just opened up a case with Washington State Attorney General Office too as well.It has been so hard to sell as a seller on Amazon right now.Its getting harder and harder every day.3rd party sellers have no value for Amazon.It became a world that you cant look for your rights. You are guilty of every complaint and you need to accept it and try to make up a solution for it.Its getting more and more stressful every day. They will hold your fund and they might not even give it to you. Even when righting this after maybe 10 Appeals working with professionals they decide not to open the account anymore. Even though we have all the documents showing all items purchased through legitimate wholesalers.All the information still they didnt.OK!Dont activate it but you cant decide and say we dont sell Authentic products unless you really have an explanation other than we cant confirm your wholesalers!Is that all you got for $230.000???
This is my complaint to the Attorney General and also i will send my complaints to Senators who will talk To Jeff Bezos in front of House Representatives Committee. It needs to stop , We have families we have workers we have rents to pay too!I am also opening up a youtube channel about these issues.
"" Hi,
We are a 3rd party seller on Amazon.com. We sell on amazon.com for a long time already. Our business went up so much during the PAndemic time because most sellers were not selling on amazon so our business went up more than 20x during the time. We worked as a family to fulfill the orders. Since our business went up so much we end up investing more money into this business. I have borrowed money from My Father, i used their credit cards to buy merchandise, i buy the products with their store together so we bought so much stuff together.i hired more workers during this time to help us.Amazon doesnt care at all if you have payments if you have workers that you have to pay. If you have people working if you have rents to pay. Suddenly they can freeze your account and hold your money. Eventually, they did that to us. They brought up a bunch of complaints which are called inauthentic in their term. Almost all of those complaints are from 7-7 months ago and they just brought that up. It made us think that what is the purpose of this. Its such an awkward situation that even one of the companies is out of business almost 6-7 months ago.We are in the grocery business and most importantly we sell imported goods.As you would know imported goods are the most secure and most inspected food business in the U.S . Manufacturers needs to be approved by USDA and obtain a USDA number so they can actually export their products into the U.S . Not only that. at the time of the import , customs requires all original invoices from the importer with their USDA numbers written on the invoice.They get through inspections and all.Now Amazon claims we sold inauthentic products , they decide that and they hold your money. When i say they decide i mean it because, after we send all the documents, without any explanation they tell you that we can not confirm you. Confirm us??? How? What did you do to confirm us? Where is your explanation??? They are holding $230.000 of us.I have even paid companies to help us with an appeal because they send you the same answer no matter what. They dont count you as human beings i guess they dont care and they dont even help you.Because of them now i am depressed, i use medicines, my parents got sick because of the sick.My after cant get up stress hit his back . My brother needed to find my from friends so he can pay the products i bought to sell on Amazon. Its not only us , but there are also so many sellers on Amazon complains the same thing. They are all depressed. I will follow up this with Senators too as well. Because i heard that Jeff Bezos will go in front of Senate for similar issues, at least hurting small businesses.You can not hold someones money unless you really are sure. Also, whats so weird and their Account Health Support reps also saying that is, you need to accept you are guilty, you dint defence yourself! Can you believe that,she said you cant get your account activated unless you accept that you are guilty?So what happens is you accept you are guilty you try to make up things by saying that, i did this i did that , it wont happen again because i will do this i will do that.I dont know who can help me?or someone can help me against this company? i cant believe they can practise such a business in the U.S by hurting others.Your help will be appreciated highly.
Our seller name on Amazon is IEATWORLD
we have one more invoice we have sent them but i cant attach it here since it only allows 5 files.
Also one of the file is our Appeal to them and keep getting refused again. With an answer just one SENTENCE which is ""Please send the following information:
Copies of invoices or receipts from your supplier issued in the last 365 days for the following ASINs:"" Which are the ones we appealing.Also whats weird is that they want us to send them an invoice within 365 days even though these complaints are very old some of the items we dont even sell them anymore it was sold like 8 months ago and purchased couple months before that which can NOT be in 365 days because IT CANT.

What Went Wrong
I listed ASIN: B01CV08XF0 Title: Mega Bloks Blaze Monster Machine Mashup. While I listed this to see how many could be sent into FBA due to the Coronavirus, I realize Amazon""s policy states that if you list an item you have the intent to sell. I am not approved to sell items under the brand Mega Bloks. I accept being at fault in this situation.
What I Have Done to Fix the Problem
I reviewed these links that Amazon provided:
https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G200333160
https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/200301050
I have also read several articles to strengthen my knowledge of the laws of this industry. I am now empowered to be able to effectively review an individual product before I list it. This will now take place before any product is listed. I plan to ask every source I buy from where these products originated from to ensure they are compliant in the location I intend to sell them. In addition to this, I will now review the restricted product policy, examples of prohibited listings, and my own product catalog on a regular basis. I will also consistently view my account""s health and performance page to ensure my account does not fall out of good standing for any reason other than the one at hand.
What I Have Done to Fix the Problems
Reading Amazon""s recommended articles, implementing precautionary steps before a listing is made, asking my sources where their products originated from, and reviewing policies will keep the problem from recurring.
Here is my suppliers information who offered this product to me (insert supplier""s information here). Lastly, I cannot provide you with an invoice from this supplier because I never ended up purchasing ASIN: B01CV08XF0 from (Insert supplier here).

1512,Account suspension without inauthentic complaint,"Hello,
Our account suspended due to inauthentic complaints.
We are selling charcoals/coals. We never seen fake charcoal on our lives.
Amazon provided us 3 ASINS and requested to write POA.
We went though 3 ASINS.
We received 477 orders.
We received 4 returns.
2 of the return reasons were bought by mistake.
1 of the return reason marked is unknown, and item returned to inventory
1 of the return reason was missing accessories or parts.
We investigated this return because it was the only thing we could not find the exact return reason.
Order placed on April 5th.
Return reques received on April 9th.
Item delivered to customer on April 11th.
Basically, customer knew that the item was going to arrive to him/her with missing parts or accessory.
He knew that 2 days ago before the delivery.
We checked all our account, return reasons, messages with the customers, our feedbacks, and voice of the customer page.
We did not see any complaint for 3 asins Amazon provided. We only have 11 ASINS listed on our account.
If there is no inauthentic complaint, how can we write plan of action requested?
They want us to give them the reason that caused the complaints. As we checked everything, we cant see complaints. We sell charcoals and we do not know who fake charcoal.We never seen any.
We just want sellers opinions or Amazon moderator opinions on our situation.
How can we go deep and see what are the complaints we received if we received any? We did everything possible to understand this.
Amazon sends emails and say we can contact with account heath department but there is no way to contact them.

1513,Trump merch,"Hello!
Is it a violation to sell Trump flags and stickers. I just got my account suspended because my products may be inauthentic even though they are sold as Generic and have no brand/labels.
If the Trump 2020 flags are trademarked and protected then how can so many big sellers be selling them for 6 dollars?
Most of my items are my original designs but contain the mark TRUMP in either the design or product name. Is this also illegal?

1517,We decided that you may no longer sell on Amazon.com,"Hi,
We got suspended on 3rd Aug for Trademark Violation.
The back story
We got a notification email from Amazon via email on 3rd July 2019 for around 22 ASINs (One Product with Size and Color Variation) to the effect ""We are contacting you because we have removed the ASINs attached to this e-mail because of concerns that your product may not respect the intellectual property rights of others, specifically for potential misuse of trademarked terms on a product detail page or patents""
The email also said that If you believe your ASINs were removed in error, for example, because you are authorized to use the trademarked term, or because you believe your use of the trademarked term is unrelated to any intellectual property, you may email Seller Support with supporting documentation (e.g., a letter of authorization to use the Brands intellectual property or a licensing agreement)
Then around 22nd July 2019 we noticed that our Account Dashboard was showing all these ASINs as been removed for Potential Trademark Misuse
As Amazon had removed these ASINs and over the course of a year we have only sold about 10 pieces (one of our worse selling item), we did not think much of it and physically deleted the listing from our account too.
Then on 3rd August we got the dreaded Your Amazon selling account has been deactivated.
Why did this happen?
We arrived at this decision after detecting multiple violations of our listing policies
Were here to help.
If you need help better understanding what is causing this, please search for Intellectual Property Violations in Seller Central Help
To reactivate your selling account, please send us the following:
A plan of action that explains:
 The root cause(s).
 The actions you have taken to resolve the notices of infringement or violation of Amazons policies.
 The steps you have taken to prevent infringement or violating Amazons policies.
So although it is a single product but due to 22 size\colour variations, amazon might be treating it as multiple listing violations.
Anyhow Since this suspension I submitted multiple POAs but not had a single reply, which I found very unusual as 7+ years of selling on Amazon USA and UK, if you get your plan of action wrong Amazon do come back to the seller with something so that a resolution can be found.
As I was not getting any replies, some how I got a UK based Global Manager to see if he could dig any information and the very next day I got a performance notification stating We reviewed your account and the information you provided, and we decided that you may no longer sell on Amazon.com.
7+ years of selling on Amazon just wiped out? Is there still a chance to get it reinstated? or does this mean curtains?
The issue was that just one ASIN of the 22 had a back-end keyword search term that was infringing on a registered term but because they were all grouped in one parent\child variation the whole parent variation got pulled. This was a silly mistake on our part and this particular ASIN was created over 4-5 years ago.
For 10+ weeks I have been trying to communicate with Amazon.com but not getting any replies. Is there any way forward?

1518,Listing removed used sold as new,"So I have a question to some of you more seasoned sellers
We just received another used sold as new listing removal notice
Weve received a few in the past and had to make up a reason to build a plan to have the ASIN restored
I have never sold anything used as new
Oddly enough with the ASINs in question I have the same 2 competing sellers
With a prior ASIN a competing seller purchased an item claimed it was used, left feedback stating this, & the best part was the ASIN was closed and the feedback mongoloids wouldnt removed the feedback
So now there is a new product same 2 seller my only competition and this morning a used as new listing notice for the geniuses at pq
Any suggestions on how to word a plan of action for something you actually DID NOT DO?
Any suggestions on how to proceed with the competing sellers? Yes I have reported them and nothing has happened

I have not received any response from Amazon to my appeal, does the email mean my account is suspended forever?
This my submission 1:
Submission 1
April 16, 2020 6:48 PM CST
The root cause of the issue
A) My products were suspected for infringing intellectual property rights.
From March 17, 2020 to March 24, 2020, these products were marked as Suspected Intellectual Property Violation and listings were removed.
All of these products were sourced from DEYUE technology company on Mar 17, 2019 and Mar 4, 2020. Please refer the invoices.
I thought DEYUE was the patent owner because they provided valid patent certificate to me, and the national registration number(304436969) can be checked on WIPO Global Design Database (https://www3.wipo.int/designdb/en/index.jsp).
Apr 1, 2019, I was authorized by DEYUE and begun to sell these products on Amazon. Please refer the authorization.
Mar 20,2020, I confirmed with Amazon Seller Support (Case ID: 6891217921), and I realized these products were infringing the design patent of Apple company.
B) I did not compare the patent picture with actual product before selling these product.
DEYUEs patent only includes a component of these infringing products, but other parts of these products are other companys patent. DEYUEs products combined other companys patent with their patent. I did not compare the patent pictures with actual products before, that made me used the intellectual property of others without authorization. That was my mistake that did not compare patent with actual product in my sourcing.
My sourcing process only verified whether a patent certificate is exist and belong to supplier, but could not verified whether a actual product was completely matched with its patent picture.
For saving time to add product in time, I did not download the patent picture and checked it with actual product.
C) My sourcing process did not have a professional way to check whether the products require authorization.
I did not provide more time doing a full research on these product before selling,.
I apology that I am lack of Amazons intellectual property policy and I didnt learn the important policy proactively.
For decreasing expenses, I did not consult an intellectual property attorney to ensure that nothing did not violate intellectual property when I sell product.
The actions you have taken to resolve the issue
A) Immediate Action Taken on Infringing Products:
We immediately removed all listings that are flagged Suspected Intellectual Property Violations.

[Zero Inventory]
ASIN [B07TQ6YQQR]
Order ID [mo-0401003]
B) Immediate Action Taken on Other Inventory
Our inventory includes product sourced from other suppliers and product developed by ourselves, we took different action to them:
a) Rechecked inventory which are sourcing by other supplier:
[ Determined Our Supplier was Legal ]
1.We collected company information of all our suppliers, including copy document of business license and ID card of legal representative.
2.We verified company information on National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System (NECIPS, http://www.gsxt.gov.cn/index.html), and made sure business license and ID card of legal representative were matched with the information of NECIPS, to prevent supplier providing counterfeit business license.
3.If one supplier provide counterfeit business license, we stop working with them.
[ Determined Supplier was the Owner/Holder of Intellectual Property ]
1.We required suppliers to provide copy documents or electronic files of intellectual property (IP), and checked their company information match the holder of copyright/ trademark/ patent to determined our supplier is the owner of IP.
2.We verified registration numbers of intellectual property on database of State Intellectual Property Office. (Verified copyright on US Copyright Office, Webside: www.copyright.gov; Verified trademark/ patent on United States Patent and Trademark Office, Webside: www.uspto.gov; Verified patent on World Intellectual Property Organization, Webside: www.wipo.int). If one supplier is not the owner of IP, we stop cooperating with him, and contact with the original owner to apply for authorization.
[ Determined Product was Required Authorization by Four Checking Steps]
Search similar product with Google Images (https://images.google.com/).
Check registration number of IP (provided by supplier) on USPTO and WIPO database, and compare actual product with patent picture. If actual product match with its patent picture, we will continue to next checking process; If actual product did not match with its patent picture, we would delete this product in our inventory and stopped selling it on Amazon.
Search similar patents with Patent Classification on USPTO. We followed the Seven Step Strategy of USPTO (https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/support-centers/patent-and-trademark-resource-centers-ptrc/resources/seven to search similar patents :
(1) List terms to describe our products based on its purpose, composition and use.
(2) Use these terms to find initial relevant Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) using the USPTO websites Site Search box (www.uspto.gov).
(3) Verify the relevancy of CPC classification we found by reviewing the CPC Classification Definition linked to it.
(4) Patent search using CPC with quick search form, and view actual patent. Base on abstract and representative drawing of patent, we determine whether it is similar to our product. If it is similar to our product, we delete this product in our inventory; If it is not similar to our product, we go ahead to next step.
(5) Review specification, includes field of invention, background, summary, brief description of the drawings and detailed description, etc. If our product is similar to the patent, we delete this product in our inventory; If not, we go ahead to next step.
(6) After identified relevant CPC classification for our product in Step 3, we access AppFT (Applications Full-Text and Image) Database to see if someone else previously disclosed an product similar to us.
(7) Those we found similar to our product would warrant even closer examination by our attorney.
Combining above three steps, we employed intellectual property attorney to check, analyze and determine our other products that determined other products did not infringe on patent rights of others. For improving our analyzing skill, we provided our attorney with the document of similar patents and Google images which we had checked before, and analyzed the different between our product and similar patent, and verified the reason why our product did not infringe on these patents.
[ Confirmed Our Other Product Was Authorized ]
Combining above steps:
Our other suppliers are the IP owner/holder of other inventory and we are authorized by them.
Our other inventories are completely matched with patent pictures.
Through checking by Google Imagine, USPTO database system and intellectual property attorney again, our other inventories do not infringe other intellectual property.
b) Rechecked Inventory Which Developed by Ourselves:
Recorded ASIN, SKU, product name, product picture, patent picture and registration number of these product (Please refer attach file""b1"").
Verified product can be matched with its patent certification and evaluation reports (Please refer attach file""b2"").
c) Added 3 point policy to all future offering and page creation:
Products form new supplier must have the business invoice and authorization to market from the manufacturer or authorized distributor in hard copy (as well as on the computer) before listing.
A patent certification of new product must be checked by 2 people to guard against repeat of this error.
All listings must have a hard copy of the inventory page with picture for our future reference before shelving.
The steps you have taken to prevent the issue going forward
Implementing the above checking to our regular suppliers immediately.
Our offering for these infringing product are removed and we will never handle that product again.
We stop sourcing from new suppliers, and focus on inventing our own product.
We apply for intellectual property protection for our product before selling on Amazon.
Our company will be evaluated annually by intellectual property agents, and they assist us finishing the intellectual property applications.
We only sale the products that are invented by ourselves to stop infringement going forward.
If we find that the product requires brand rights but we are not authorized, we will follow the steps to solve this problem:
(1) Remove all infringing listing immediately;
(2) Check sourcing, listing and packaging process to identify any potential trademarks, patent or copyright issues;
(3) Check on Google Imagine to search the product of possible brand/right owner;
(4) Preliminary search with USPTO and WIPO database to confirm the trademarks, patent or copyright issues;
(5) Contact third party agent of intellectual property to determine brand/right owner and get the contact information;
(6) Contact brand/right owner and request a letter of authorization to sell their products on Amazon;
(7) Confirm the proper supply chain with right owner;
(8) Required the contact information for a brand representative who can keep us up to date on the brands policies, especially as they pertain to selling their products on Amazon. Proactively.
(9) Check in with brand representatives at least quarterly to inquire about any updates on brand policies and to ensure the maintenance of strong working relationships.
We are a small technology company, the only one way to stop infringing in the future is selling the product which is developed by ourselves and obtain a patent certificate through examination by an intellectual property institution. We continue to develop our product and we are not going out on Amazon. Our plan was never to leave this platform. We are eager to do better. We have great respect for the spectacular online retail market Amazon has created. Respectfully and sincerely I request that our account be reactivated.

Is my account suspended forever?? But I have not received the email that says I can not sell anymore.

1521,Restricted Products POA feedback,"Final Draft 
Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team,
Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to appeal my seller accounts suspension for listing restricted products that are prohibited from sale on Amazon.
What went wrong:
 In fact, I did unknowingly list a restricted product. I believe the error occurred in the information I provided when the listing was completed. Furthermore, Ive come to learn that Targus maybe a product that requires additional authorization to sell on your site
 At the end of last year, I regained access to my seller account,I noticed new performance notifications. Now, the performance notification stated the restriction was for selling restricted products, laser pointers. After researching the Amazon Seller forums on restricted products and how to do plans of appeal, I prepared an appeal to state my case.
 Please note, I was given 48 hours to remove the restricted products. However, at the time I was given that opportunity I never realized it. Upon my original account deactivation a few years back, I became discouraged and never appealed that decision, or looked back. Which is why I never noticed the new performance notifications, and missed the 48-hour deadline. Since then, the product in question has been removed.
 Originally upon recieving the 48 hour notice, I was unable to respond due to being hospitalized. Upon returning to health I discovered the error, but unfortunately it was too late to correct as it was passed as the 48 hours.
Recently, after doing my research on the Amazon Seller forums, I decided to give it another chance and try again to in the beginning I recall myaccount being deactivated for suspicious activity.
 At the end of last year, I decided to give selling another shot, I looked into my seller account, and I noticed the newest performance notifications. After researching the Amazon Seller forums on restricted products, and how to do plans of appeal, I prepared an appeal to state my case.
What I have done to fix the issue.
 I have carefully reviewed all of Amazons guidelines. Furthermore, to prevent any such violations from occurring in the future, Ive researched information regarding the sale of restricted products, the correct way to aadvertise my products.
 Ive educated myself about the products that are prohibited from sale and cant be listed. This includes your Restricted Products policy, including the Examples of Prohibited Listings section. Though its important to point out Ive never missed it a prohibited item, I have educated myself on what those items are to prevent any problems in the future.
 The final step Ive taken is to remove all of the listings that were in doubt, and being questioned. In the future, I will double check all of my listings to make sure that the products are described accurately, and are fully compliant with the rules that Amazon has set forth.
What I will do to prevent this from happening again:
 What I will do to prevent this from happening again:I believe the error occurred in the listing. In the future to prevent this from happening, if theres anything that Im not absolutely certain about I will call you guys for a clear explanation.
 Ive educated myself about the products that are prohibited from sale, and cant be listed. This includes your Restricted Products policy, including the Examples of Prohibited Listings section. Though its important to point out Ive never missed it a prohibited item, I have educated myself on what those items are to prevent any problems in the future.
 Before listing any new items on Amazon, I will verify that they are permitted for sale, and compliant with Amazon policies and procedures.
 To help me ensure that I do not violate any more policies, I will also research whether all of my products are accurately described, and correctly listed in the most informative way for any potential buyers.
 I will routinely review Amazons policies to stay aware of any updates, and to monitor changes in regulations. I will review my email daily for any notifications or emails you send out on your policy to stay in tune with whats going on. Also weekly expensive reviews of any uploaded tutorials will be watched and monitoed. These actions will ensure I can immediately take action, and proactively remain compliant with my listings. Any products that I am unable to verify with 100% certainty, will not be listed.
 I will also review any city, state, and federal laws/regulations regarding what I am selling to ensure that I am always in compliance. Al be sure to be in tune with any product recalls, and urgent recommendations.
In conclusion , I believe that this plan provides that this issue has been rectified, and itll be prevented from occurring again. I look forward to having my selling privileges restored. I also look forward to hearing from you! Thanks again for your time!
SIncerely,

1523,Used sold as New Appeal,"Hello,
My listing was removed for a complain of Used sold as NEW. My issue is I have looked in all my messages and order, A to Z claims and product reviews and I cant find the complain. How can I create a plan of action if I do not know what the client is stating.
I created a POA but have been rejected twice. Below is the latest one. PLease help how to address an unknown issue.
Dear Amazon USA Product Quality Team,
I would like to appeal the removal of my listing with ASIN xxx
due to Used Sold as New product condition complaints.
I understand that Amazon takes complaints about the product quality very seriously and I would like to share with you my Plan of Action addressing the issue.
What caused the complaints:
-After carefully reviewing my entire account, all orders received for the ASIN xxx, we have determined that the complaints must have been caused by some sort of packaging deficiency.
The product (a shampoo) was probably spilled, damaged or broken during transit causing the impression to the client that the product was used or deemed defective. And giving a bad customer experience.
What I have done to resolve the complaints:
-I will authorize all return requests or money requests for ASIN xxx, carefully inspecting all returned merchandise and refunded the buyers.
-I have performed an inspection in our warehouse to validate all our inventory for ASIN xxx looks in perfect condition and are not broken or spilled. (I have attached pictures of the current condition of our inventory)
-I have communicated the issue to my supplier in Miami and requested them to only provide me NEW and undamaged inventory. An inspection will be implemented when new merchandise arrives to our warehouse and I will not receive damaged inventory.
I have reviewed the Amazon condition policies, and confirmed that the listing information and condition is accurate and matches the product being sold.
-I have implemented several changes to our packaging process. From now on all our shampoos will be taped the lid before beginning the packaging process. We will cover the shampoo with flexible carton to prevent any breakage or scratching before placing into a box.
-I have put plans in place so that the product will be shipped in sturdy shipping boxes, and properly protected with protective packing material.
What I will do to prevent similar complaints in the future:
-I will continue sourcing all my inventory directly from the most reputable suppliers in my country.
-I will be regularly checking the condition of my items to ensure that all customers receive them in a 100% perfect state.
-I will ensure that my products accurately match the condition I am offering as per Amazons policies.
-I will make sure that all items are packaged as securely and carefully as possible to prevent damage during transit. T
Thank you for the opportunity to improve my process, and provide an improved customer experience.",Account Health
1524,Deactivated Account - Restricted Products,"Hey everybody,
Ive Incorporated a lot of your input about shortening my original POA, adding bullet points, and taking responsibility for listing restricted products on my account. Ive revised my POA, and included my original deactivation notice. Any feedback you may have is greatly appreciated, so please advise
Thanks in Advance!
Notification of Restricted Products Removal
Hello from Amazon, We are writing to let you know that the following detail pages have been removed from our catalog: ASIN: B005L38VT8, SKU: 3R-VBHM-7893, Title: Targus Stylus for iPad, iPhone, iPod, Samsung Tablets, Smartphones and Other Touchscreen Devices, Cream (AMM0113US) This product has been identified as a portable, handheld laser products or related handheld laser product, such as a laser pointer, laser flare, laser pen, laser stylus, pet toy laser, or related product. These products are prohibited for sale or listing on Amazon. For more information, please see the seller Help pages on Laser Pointers and Related Products. Why is this happening? We took this action because this product is not permitted for sale on Amazon.com. It is your obligation to make sure the products you offer comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and Amazons policies.

Please note that moving a restricted product listing to Inactive (Out of Stock) does not make the listing compliant. If you think your product was incorrectly identified as a restricted product on Amazon, close the listing immediately to ensure compliance while you appeal the restriction with Seller Support.
Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team,
Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to appeal my seller accounts suspension for listing restricted products that are prohibited from sale on Amazon.
What went wrong:
 In fact, I did unknowingly list a restricted product. I believe the error occurred in the information I provided when the listing was completed. Furthermore, Ive come to learn that Targus maybe a product that requires additional authorization to sell on your site
 At the end of last year, I regained access to my seller account,I noticed new performance notifications. Now, the performance notification stated the restriction was for selling restricted products, laser pointers. After researching the Amazon Seller forums on restricted products and how to do plans of appeal, I prepared an appeal to state my case.
 Please note, I was given 48 hours to remove the restricted products. However, at the time I was given that opportunity I never realized it. Upon my original account deactivation a few years back, I became discouraged and never appealed that decision, or looked back. Which is why I never noticed the new performance notifications, and missed the 48-hour deadline. Since then, the product in question has been removed.
 Originally upon recieving the 48 hour notice, I was unable to respond due to being hospitalized. Upon returning to health I discovered the error, but unfortunately it was too late to correct as it was passed as the 48 hours.
Recently, after doing my research on the Amazon Seller forums, I decided to give it another chance and try again to in the beginning I recall myaccount being deactivated for suspicious activity.
 At the end of last year, I decided to give selling another shot, I looked into my seller account, and I noticed the newest performance notifications. After researching the Amazon Seller forums on restricted products, and how to do plans of appeal, I prepared an appeal to state my case.
What I have done to fix the issue.
 I have carefully reviewed all of Amazons guidelines. Furthermore, to prevent any such violations from occurring in the future, Ive researched information regarding the sale of restricted products, the correct way to aadvertise my products.
 Ive educated myself about the products that are prohibited from sale and cant be listed. This includes your Restricted Products policy, including the Examples of Prohibited Listings section. Though its important to point out Ive never missed it a prohibited item, I have educated myself on what those items are to prevent any problems in the future.
 The final step Ive taken is to remove all of the listings that were in doubt, and being questioned. In the future, I will double check all of my listings to make sure that the products are described accurately, and are fully compliant with the rules that Amazon has set forth.
What I will do to prevent this from happening again:
 What I will do to prevent this from happening again:I believe the error occurred in the listing. In the future to prevent this from happening, if theres anything that Im not absolutely certain about I will call you guys for a clear explanation.
 Ive educated myself about the products that are prohibited from sale, and cant be listed. This includes your Restricted Products policy, including the Examples of Prohibited Listings section. Though its important to point out Ive never missed it a prohibited item, I have educated myself on what those items are to prevent any problems in the future.
 Before listing any new items on Amazon, I will verify that they are permitted for sale, and compliant with Amazon policies and procedures.
 To help me ensure that I do not violate any more policies, I will also research whether all of my products are accurately described, and correctly listed in the most informative way for any potential buyers.
 I will routinely review Amazons policies to stay aware of any updates, and to monitor changes in regulations. I will review my email daily for any notifications or emails you send out on your policy to stay in tune with whats going on. Also weekly expensive reviews of any uploaded tutorials will be watched and monitoed. These actions will ensure I can immediately take action, and proactively remain compliant with my listings. Any products that I am unable to verify with 100% certainty, will not be listed.
 I will also review any city, state, and federal laws/regulations regarding what I am selling to ensure that I am always in compliance. Al be sure to be in tune with any product recalls, and urgent recommendations.
In conclusion , I believe that this plan provides that this issue has been rectified, and itll be prevented from occurring again. I look forward to having my selling privileges restored. I also look forward to hearing from you! Thanks again for your time!
SIncerely,
Kwylas

1531,72 hours to submit plan of action,"I have 72 hours (at time of this post 50 hours remaining) to provide Amazon with a plan of action. I received the following email from Amazon after a very nice Amazon rep called me to tell me I had 72 hours to submit a POA. I recently received 3 IP complaints (2 from one brand and 1 from another brand). I did the wrong thing by not taking action immediately. I have since emailed the two brands and received no response back. My account is still active and all listings remain active for the time being.
The email from Amazon is below and so is my plan of action. If you have any feedback to help my POA or advise I would greatly appreciate it.
One important point is that I dont have proper receipts and not sure if that sinks any hopes that I have getting out of this. Most of my Amazon business is built on approved relationships with brands. However, a portion is based on OA. These infractions are related to OA.

Complaint type: Intellectual Property Complaints
ASIN: XXXX
ASIN : XXXX
ASIN : XXXX
Thank you for selling with Amazon,
The following is my plan of action. Any input to make it stronger would be appreciated.
A) What went wrong:
On March 17, 2020, April 9, 2020, and April 13 2020, I received the noted IP complaints and immediately removed these items (ASINs XXXX, XXXX and XXXX) from inventory. The root cause of these complaints was sourcing. Part of our business model is sourcing products from liquidation and clearance. This method of sourcing does not provide us with documentation that is acceptable to Amazon to authenticate that the items do not violate that intellectual property of the complainant was not violated. I take full responsibility for these IP complaints.
B) What I have done to fix the problems:
I have removed these listings from my inventory
I made contacted XXXX and XXXX regarding these complaints and informed them that I will never list any of their products; however, I have not received a response from these companies.
I have checked the remainder of our listings for any ASINs that may also violate these or other trademarks and have proactively removed 63 suspect ASINs.
In the past 24 hours, my staff and I have reviewed the details pages for all of our active listings to confirm that no other listings violate these specific trademarks and (to the best of our knowledge) any other trademarks.
After receiving these IP complaints earlier this year, I instituted a new sourcing policy. For any new items that we are considering to sell, before listing, we will check with the brand-owner, patent holder, or trademark owner to ensure that the listing of the product is acceptable.
I have reviewed the IP policy as requested and understand these policies.
I have set a quarterly reminder for myself to review the Amazon Intellectual Property Policy for any changes to this policy.
C) What I have done to prevent the problems from happening again in the future:
To address the issues raised, I have carefully read our business solutions agreement with Amazon and Amazons policies, paying careful attention to Amazons anti-counterfeiting policy and intellectual property policy and the section on restricted products. I have studied the prohibited seller activities, and product detail page rules and condition guidelines in Seller Central help. I understand that it is my responsibility to source and sell only authentic products that do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of any third parties. I understand that customers trust that they are buying authentic products when they shop on Amazon and promise to maintain this trust by only sourcing from reliable vendors.
Additionally, on an ongoing basis, we will follow the policy mentioned in B.5. (above) and continue to check the policies for updates as mentioned in B.6 and B.7 (above).
Additional details on our compliance with Amazons policies:
We have continued to ship all orders as they have come in, and to process returns/refunds, and respond to customer emails.
We have not added any additional items sourced from clearance / liquidation to our Amazon listings.
We have reviewed our Amazon listings and removed all items sourced from liquidation/clearance.",Account Health

1533,Help with my POA Product Authenticity,"Good Night, we have been suspended by allegedly selling products that its not authentic.
We bought at Bed Bath & Beyond, and we only have the Receipts I just made this POA, and really help from everyone that can help!
Dear Seller Performance,
Thank you for this chance to respond to my recent suspension for inauthentic items. We accept full responsibility for not understanding and listing items without brand authorization. We want to be compliant with Amazons policies and to provide Amazons customers with a positive experience. We appreciate the opportunity to work with you to resolve this quickly and are committed to take all necessary actions to correct the problem.
Upon hours of research and talking to other sellers, because we are a new Seller in Amazon environment we understand the problem with not being able to provide satisfactory evidence of a valid supply chain and the rights to resell branded items.
Root cause:
After applying to sell these products on Amazon, I was automatically approved and was able to list these items without submitting any documentation. I now know that this did not give me the right to list those products. I also did not properly source my inventory from a reputable distributor. I added three products to my listings which was purchased at Bed Bath & Beyond. I received a receipt for my purchase. The products that I had purchased from BB&B, were not defected or damaged. The products were the same as described on Amazon. I received the email from amazon in regards to my account being temporarily deactivated due to offering items that may be inauthentic, minutes after selling one of the questionable items in my listings. I did not receive any customer complaints in regards to the products being inauthentic.
Although we sell authentic products and provided all the receipts for those items showing authenticity, we accept responsibility for this mistake in understanding.
I do not have brand authorization letters; I can only provide my receipts for proof of purchase. I verified that the retailer is an authorized distributor of those brands.
With this new understanding, we would like to present our plan of action to address the problem.
A. The issue that caused the suspension:
We purchased products from a distributor and automatically assumed we had brand authorization from Brand Owner and Amazon.
B. Steps taken to resolve the complaint:
Since the suspension, we have deleted every single one of our listing, from our Amazon marketplace.
 We have reviewed several Amazon seller policies and fully understand what we did wrong and this will ensure that we will not repeat this mistake.
These reviewed policies include the Seller Agreement, Amazon Services Business Solution Agreement, Prohibited Seller Activities and Listing Restrictions, Restricted Products Policy, Amazons Product Safety and Compliance Guidelines, Trade of Endangered Species,"" Intellectual Property Violations Policy"" Anti-Counterfeiting Policy, Offensive and Controversial Products, Category and Product Restrictions and Policy Violations
All future listings will be measured against these policies in order to make sure that we only list authentic items.
 We have permanently deleted all of our listings for these ASINs and related ASINs or products from Amazon to ensure that this problem will never occur again.
 We blocked these ASINs and related ASINS and products in our in-house inventory management software, so that these products will never be listed again without the prior authorization from the original manufacturer.
 We have purged our entire inventory on Amazon, pulled an All Listing inventory report, and audited our listings and inventory to confirm the authenticity of all our items to ensure this wont happen again.
 We have ceased working with unauthorized distributors and suppliers. Remaining distributors and suppliers were examined to determine authenticity and authorization of other products sold.
C. What we have done to prevent similar complaints in the future:
 The actions we have taken in step B will prevent any problems from occurring in the future.
 We have developed a system to prevent the buying, listing, and selling of any product containing the intellectual property belonging to another party and will not proceed without authorization from that party and Amazon.
 We have developed a strict procedure for new suppliers and retailers that we consider working with in the future. This procedure will ensure authenticity of products and authorization from the original manufacturer.
 Should any doubts remain about inauthentic items, we have created a policy to consult with the Amazon Seller Performance Team and the original manufacturer before listing the products. We will not buy, list, or sell any items whose authenticity we cannot establish.
We have stopped working with every supplier who doesnt have legal authorization and certificates for the products in question.
We shall aggressively monitor our listings to ensure we continue meeting the standards set by Amazon and our own standards of quality customer service.
D. Supplier information
I were diligently focused on my business, but were ignorant of my account issues, and lack of sourcing items in a timely manner, this caused my current situation and I have implemented a new policy and procedures for my selling account.
I have educated myself to ensure my full compliance. Please find my receipts with full supplier information attached.
I look forward to your review and favorable decision, allowing me to continue selling on the Amazon marketplace.

PLAN OF ACTION
Submitted 4/30/2020
Seller ID: got2manybooks
Case XXXXXX351
Dear Seller Support,
Thank you for providing me an opportunity to provide this plan of action in regards to Amazons Fair Pricing Policy (FPP) violations for the 3 ASINS listed in this case. Thank you for allowing my account to stay active.
Because these 3 ASINs have 3 different situations, I have a detailed plan for each one below. However, Id like to start with these overarching actions:
Immediate action taken: As soon as I finished the April 28 phone call from Juan who informed me of the problem, I immediately put my account on vacation mode as to protect any Amazon shoppers and to prevent being in violation of any policies.
I will begin reinstating items only after the following has taken place:
I will take each product in my Amazon inventory and re-evaluate the
market pricing for each in order to comply with the FPP.
I will perform a Google shopping search for the product name to compare to top retailers such as Target, Walmart, CVS, etc.
I will then search the UPC codes on products that have them and perform the same product pricing search by UPC.
I will calculate the average price of my research and set my price to that average price or within 10% of that price.
I will delete any ASINs that I find are unprofitable under this methodology.
Individual items to follow.
ASIN B07MRB5WW3 Gillette Hydra Vitamin E Body Wash, 4 pack
What went wrong
When I listed this item in November 2019, I priced it at $69.99 for a 4 pack which was a typo as the 3 is below the 6 on a 10 digit keypad.
I failed to review pricing on a consistent basis, so I did not see the mistake in order to correct it.
I failed to completely read and then act upon the listing deactivation email I received on April 17 which was the first time this ASIN was flagged.
What I have done to fix the problem
As soon as I received the policy violation email on April 20 I looked at the listing and realized the pricing error. I repriced it at my original intended $39.99 which is ~$10 a bottle. I used Amazons Pricing Policy to set this price. Since there was (and as of this writing) no other Amazon offers for me to use Amazons Policy on Reference Pricing (PORP) of this discontinued formulation of body wash, I determined this price based on what Ive been selling other discontinued body washes for and what comps were on marketplaces which sell like items (Mercari, Etsy, eBay, etc.)
Upon receipt of the account review phone call and email on April 28, I changed the inventory level from 1 to 0.
I read the Fair Pricing Policy (FPP) again in full. I know that it is my responsibility to price items using the pricing methodology as I have detailed on page 1.
As this item never sold, I did not have any customers to contact and offer pricing parity refunds.
What I will do to prevent this from happening again
Before listing any items that are still in production and readily available in the general marketplace and on Amazon, I will complete the pricing methodology as detailed on page 1.
Before listing any items that have been discontinued by the manufacturer and are no longer stocked/available in the general marketplace, I will compare the current supply & demand pricing on other marketplaces which sell like items (Mercari, Etsy, eBay, etc.) to determine if listing the item at the supply & demand price on Amazon would violate the fair pricing policy.
I will not list any discontinued items that are currently selling at an average supply & demand price high violate the fair pricing policy.
I will schedule Saturday mornings as my pricing review time in order to compare my offer price to other current offers and adjust accordingly.
I will read every email correspondence completely and thoroughly and will contact Seller Support immediately with any questions.
If action is called for, I will act on these emails quickly and will contact Seller Support immediately with any questions.
ASIN B00JONZEFA ZEST BATH BAR OCEAN BREEZE 3X4 OZ
What went wrong
I failed to completely read and then act upon the listing deactivation email I received on April 17 which was the first time this ASIN was flagged.
What I have done to fix the problem
As soon as I received the policy violation email on April 20 I looked at the listing and lowered the price from $7.36 to $5.36. Even though I would lose money at this price, I only had 1 set in inventory, it had not sold since I listed it in July 2019, so at least it could go to someone who needs to order soap online due to COVID-19.
Upon receipt of the account review phone call and email on April 28, I changed the inventory level from 1 to 0.
I read the fair pricing policy in full and have determined that the price that was flagged for violating FPP is far below what any other seller has offered or is currently offering it for and may be an error. I have lowered the price several times since listing it and have offered this 3 pack (9 bars) at $7.36 since 2/2/2020. As of this writing, these are the comparable prices:
Dobo has a 1 pack(3 bars) listed at 11.99
BigDreams has a 2 pack(6bars) listed for $12.99
Sale Force CA has 8 bars listed for 19.99
Maxipoo2 has 4 bars listed for 10.99
As this item never sold, I did not have any customers to contact and offer pricing parity refunds.
What I will do to prevent this from happening again
I will read every email correspondence completely and thoroughly and will contact Seller Support immediately with any anomalies like this where perhaps an automated pricing algorithm is faulty. (?)
If action is called for, I will act on these emails quickly and will contact Seller Support immediately with any questions.
ASIN B01CRE8VO8 Excedrin ES Caplets, 100 ct
What went wrong
I did not know or understand until Juan told me on the phone that Amazons FPP supersedes or overrides the Pricing Policy which includes the PORP. He informed me that I can not base my price on what other sellers are selling it for. Part of my business plan includes sourcing discontinued and hard to find items to offer up for the products loyal following to purchase. I have a scanning app that tells me what the current offers on Amazon are, and thats what comparable prices I used when I first listed this on 3/6/2020 at $25.95 which was less than the current low price.
After learning that Excedrin was experiencing a temporary supply issue, I sourced the product to list it like I do with discontinued products, pricing it with the policy that states, You may list items at any price you feel is fair, regardless of the Amazon price or list price, within the limits set by Amazon, and so long as your price adheres to the parity requirements of your selling agreement and the policy on reference prices."" Additionally, I found no parity requirement in my selling agreement- is this link broken? Or is the parity agreement missing from my User Agreement?
As stated previously, I failed to completely read and then act upon the listing deactivation email I received on April 2 which was the first time this ASIN was flagged. Since I had sold all my units for between $25.00 - $31.00 from 3/7 to 3/13, I didnt understand that the deactivation emails were counting against me even with the listing inactive.
What I have done to fix the problem
Upon receipt of the account review phone call and email on April 28, I changed the inventory level to 0.
I read the fair pricing policy again in full. I know that it is my responsibility to price items using the pricing methodology as I have detailed on page 1.
I plan to delete all other Excedrin ASINs and sell the remaining inventory on another platform.
What I will do to prevent this from happening again
Before listing any items that are in short supply and high demand because of the manufacturer having supply chain issues or the like, I will compare the current supply & demand pricing on other marketplaces which sell like items (Mercari, Etsy, eBay, etc.) to determine if listing the item at the supply & demand price on Amazon would violate the fair pricing policy.
I will not list any such items that are currently selling at an average supply & demand price high violate the fair pricing policy.
I will schedule Saturday mornings as my pricing review time in order to compare my offer price to other current offers and adjust accordingly.
I will read every email correspondence completely and thoroughly and will contact Seller Support immediately with any questions.
If action is called for, I will act on these emails quickly and will contact Seller Support immediately with any questions.
In closing, I appreciate your time in reading my plan. Additionally, I have created the analysis below to show that while in March my volume increased exponentially, my average sales/order item was average compared to the last 2 years. No price gouging took place. The increase was due to volume alone. Regardless, I vow to be far more conscientious of pricing. I look forward to many more years as an Amazon seller.

1535,Created a New Account,"Hi Forum,
Last year I created an account to sell and totally forgot about it due to work, I was receiving messages to send in my bills to confirm who I was and my address.
I literally did not send any info in until all these complications started around the world and many of us lost our full time gigs. So probably like a lot of people I said let me give amazon selling a chance now that I have time.
I kept getting declined after sending in every bill possible and every time I would get support on the phone they would just tell me to re-upload and at some point I should get approved.
After calling in for weeks I finally got someone in the US on the phone and he told me to create a new account that my old one was basically never going to get approved for the simple fact I didnt send my info in on time.
He said to simply make a new one with a new email, I questioned him at first because like other marketplaces its not allowed to make multiple accounts.
He kept ensuring that I would be fine and just to make a new one with a new email.
So I made one, and within 24 hours the new account was closed because
We found that your account is related to an account that may not be used to sell on our site. As a result, you may no longer sell on Amazon.com.
I called again to see what was up and now the new rep told me to ensure that the new account I was making was with totally new information.
I am really not trying to do anything wrong and follow the rules but why are reps saying one thing and the amazon computers doing a completely different thing by closing my accounts?
If anyone could please help me It would be greatly appreciated.

Dear Amazon Seller Performance,
I recognize and understand the mistakes I made to bring us to this point.
These are my mistakes:
I started to create my seller account 1/14/2020 and had to stop as I needed additional information and documents. The next day 1/15/2020 I logged into my buyer account and clicked Sell I continued registering with what I thought was my existing seller account. Two days after completion I was notified my account was linked to a different account that may not be used to sell on this site. I believe I could have two accounts: one started but not completed and one completed but deactivated. This was Not intentional and was a misunderstanding.

17. 5th Appeal. Regional accounts in good standing and PofA submitted.
March 2, 2020 11:13 AM MST
Additional information
Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team,
Thank you for providing me the opportunity to submit additional information to appeal my seller accounts deactivation due to the account being related to an account that may not be used to sell on Amazon.
I believe the related account to be my EU and JP regional accounts Middle Fork.
I understand that Amazon takes the security of their sellers and customers very seriously and I would like to share with you what lead to my seller accounts being deactivated.
Please let me restate what happened:
 Opened a new seller account in North American region, 01/15/2020
 While opening North America account selected Europe and Japan markets unknowingly.
 Immediately received many FBA welcome emails from overseas regions and marketplaces. Intentions were not to sell overseas. Ultimately, emails stopped after all accounts deactivated, 01/17/2020.
Steps I have taken to attempt reactivation:
 Submitted documents for the EU and Japan region accounts as requested by Seller Performance. 2/24/2020
 Europe and Japan accounts reactivated and in good standing. 2/25/2020
I believe that when I inadvertently opened the accounts in the other regions, they were not correctly linked to my original account, causing all accounts to be deactivated.
I believe this information sufficiently addresses the issues with my deactivation and I hope that I will be able to continue selling on Amazon.
Sincerely,
I never intended to sell Europe or Japan. Ironically this is the only place I can sell at this time. I do feel that if I had never inadvertently opened those account I would be well on my way to selling. Is there anything else I can do?
I have now unfortunately sent 5 appeals. My regional accounts are good. I do not have any related accounts that may not sell on this site. My challenge now is to have my account reviewed by a team member and NA account to recognize the regional account are no longer suspended. Do you think at this point I am just considered spam and have a slim chance of another review? Do I wait it out with my 5th appeal and stop with any more appeals or emails?
Thanks again for any help or suggestions,

1538,Amazon account suspended,"Hello Guys,
I have been an Amazon seller since the beginning of 2019
I am not a big seller, but a few things that I sell are doing very good and I was planning to hugely invest and develop my Amazon business in 2020. I cannot describe how shocked I was when I received the following message from Amazon:
Hello ,1st Green Lab
Your Amazon.com Seller account has been deactivated. Your listings have been disabled. Funds will not be transferred to you but will be held in your account while we work with you to address this issue. Please ship any open orders to avoid further impact to your account.
Why is this happening?
Your Amazon seller account has been deactivated in accordance with section 3 of Amazons Business Solutions Agreement. We found that your current selling account is related to a different selling account created in DATE: 11/ 2019 which violated our policies and is not allowed to sell on our site. As a result, you may no longer use the current selling account to sell on Amazon.com.
The thing is that I have never created another Amazon account for myself, as this would have been the violation of the rules - I am aware that I have to ask an exemption first. The only reason I can think of is another account created by my brother. Long story short, he created a Professional Amazon account registered for another company (located in different country), as he was planning to build a separate brand for a completely different product category (dietary supplements). This would have been stupid to allow him to sell on my account stuff that another company manufactures and sell. Moreover, his account was suspended straight after the registration with the following notification:

For your security, we have suspended your Amazon seller account. During our review, you will not be able to sell on Amazon. Please ship any open orders. If you have any funds in your account, they will be available after any amounts paid for A-to-Z claims or chargebacks on your orders have been deducted. This usually takes about 90 days, but funds may be held longer.
Why is this happening?
We need additional documentation to verify your identity. If you currently sell on Amazon , we need to verify a change to your payment methods. If you did not make this change, contact Seller Support.
How do I reactivate my account?
Please provide the following documents and confirm that there is a valid credit card on file:
 A bill that is dated within the last 90 days for piped or natural gas, electricity, piped water, or internet service with name and address visible
 Business license, if applicable

So, he has provided a water bill and had a valid credit card on file. But still his account was not reactivated after an appeal.
Instead, a month later, he received the following notification:
Your Amazon seller account has been deactivated. Your listings have been removed. Funds will not be transferred to you but will be held in your account while we work with you to address this issue. Please ship any open orders to avoid further impact to your account.
Why is this happening?
Your Amazon seller account has been deactivated in accordance with section 3 of Amazons Business Solutions Agreement. This decision was made after reviewing both your account and the information provided.
() We may not reply to further emails about this issues.
And this is true, they have stopped answering any emails or appeals on both our accounts.
To sum up, I believe that neither me or my brother had violated any of the policies. The main reason for both of our account suspensions is that we use the device to login into the seller central, but this NOT is a violation of the rules.
I hope that the performance team will see this message and reactivate both of our accounts.",Account Health

1542,Action Required: Listing Removed from Amazon.com (Used Sold as New),"My listing has been removed for one of my high performing items (high performing relative to me). The allegation is that a used item was sold as new, which is categorically false.
To give you some background, last week I received my first ever return request on this item. The reason he gave was that he was not impressed with the quality, and he indicated there was also a scratch on the item. At the time I found it suspicious, specifically his comment about quality because we have sold over a 1000 of these with glowing reviews(and almost all are about quality), and we also offer a 3 year long warranty on the product. No one has ever complained about quality. (Customers usually buy 1 and then come back to buy 2-3 more usually within a week of 1st purchase. We know we have a good product).
He obviously got this return auto approved and he also got a prepaid return label. The guy has not shipped it back yet. I am still waiting on the product back to see what he is actually talking about.
We own the brand.We are not buying from a third party or a drop shipper. We can categorically deny that we ever sent him a used product.
My product has a 5 star rating. All my metrics are well within range. We sell a few thousand items a month so I get my fair share of hits, but my account health is pretty good.
I simply do not understand why my listing got removed but here we are.
I need to know how to respond to this complaint so I can reinstate my listing. When I go to appeal, they ask
What caused customers to complain about the condition of your items?
His complaint is categorically false. Honestly I dont know why he complained. Either he wanted a free prepaid label or he is an upcoming competitor. But we never sent a used item. In fact the shipment just landed a week before. We were out of the product for a while.
What have you done to resolve the issue(s) that caused the customer complaints about the condition of your items?
We have not done anything. We are not planning on doing anything different. We sell brand new factory sealed products.
What actions will you be taking to prevent future complaints about the condition of your items?
I am not going to do a darn thing different. We sell factory sealed brand new products.
The tone of these questions is very irritating. They start from an assumption of guilt.

I am writing this thread because I have to write a plan of action for violating the Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy
The asin is  ASIN: B07PQYDBJM
 Policy violation: Fair Pricing Abuse
its a 40 count persil detergent box, I also sold the 15 count a couple of times, I think these items are resonably priced 15$ above its original price. The detergent costs 11.99 at Target and the product dimensions are too big for a flat rate or legal flat so cubic is the way to go which is about $9 avg. + Amazon fee of 2.40 brings me to 11.40 in items total expenses and am left with 3.60 per sale. Which is not a lot if you count my sales. Anyway, I sold that item about twice and none of the customers complained directly to me about their orders. Then, the listing remained inactive and out of stock until I got a message from Amazon for a potential temporarily suspension due to abusing the Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy.

1548,Appeal a listing removal?,"Hi,
Weve been selling on Amazon Marketplace for about 2 months. Weve had about 2000 orders. Recently, for 2 of our products, we received notifications that our customers complained that we were shipping used items and those listings were removed from our account.
We have submitted 1 of 2 appeals and had that appeal denied. Here is the high level:
We have sold about 100 units of this item. We have had no returns of the item and we never ship returned goods to our customers. All items are packaged to meet or exceed ISTA3A standards. We provide no cost replacement parts or complete units if necessary. We have received 0 A-to-Z complaints across all our offerings.
Additionally, the ASINs in question are not listings we have created. They are items that upwards of 20 people resell on Amazon.
All I know is that a customer complained to Amazon (not to us) about receiving a used item. While I do not doubt that a box could have arrived torn open and its contents partially damaged, I am 100% positive the item shipped was brand new in the manufacturers packaging.
Here is my appeal:
In my appeal I have included a copy of my invoice (costs redacted) to Amazon showing proof of purchase. When it denied my appeal it stated I could expand upon my plan to resolve this matter, however, Im uncertain what else I can do. I also have been provided no means to share an updated plan with Amazon.
I want to address the 2nd ASIN appeal, but Im uncertain how to effectively do that. While I understand that a customer can complain about receiving a used product at anytime, I know not how to prove to Amazon that we never ship used goods. Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Paul",Account Health
1549,Timeline for Suspended Account (inauthentic) Appeal,"Good Morning all,
Does anyone know the current time that it takes to get a response to an appeal for account suspension? I assume theres a backlog since were 6 - 7ish days into ours, having submitted invoices but have not heard anything back. Probably not odd, but we got hit due to items that we put into an FBA inbound shipping plan, though we are approved to sell them on Amazon and we have Permission from the brand to sell them. Is there anything else we should do other than continued patience?

1550,Section 3 Email after submitting POA for Authenticity - PLEASE GUIDE,"Hi I was suspended on March 3-2020 & have been working with Amazon to get reinstated but with no success.
I received the below most recent communication on April 23. I have also pasted the original notice (March 3, 2020).
April 23, 2020
April 7, 2020
March 3,2020
The good part is: Last week, I was finally able to identify the root cause as to why/where an in authenticity complaint came in. I figured our that I missed reading a negative product review maybe which triggered amazon to send a request for invoice and hence the suspension.
As a seller selling on Amazons listings, we never look at product reviews as tons of seller have an offer on the same product .We have always taken care of direct customer messages or seller feed-backs. FYI - Our Account health metrics is perfect - Zero Violations.
@SELLC @Cassie_Amazon @Pax_Amazon @Abraham_Amazon @Melinda_Amazon
I have developed the below POA . Can you share feedbackA?
Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team:
Thank you for an opportunity to present our case in greater detail. We have finally identified the accurate root cause and have explained below necessary corrections to boost quality standards & exceed customer expectations. I have also attached plan of action as PDF & word doc for better readability.
 Greater detail on Root Causes of Product Authenticity Customer Complaints.
During the peak season (Jan-2020), we were operating at 3x our regular order volume & did not have robust processes to audit product quality  especially for ASINs obtained and listed in Used condition. This allowed a defective unit of ASIN - XXXXX (listed in Used condition) pass through and create bad buying experience for a customer.
We were not able to fix this because we did not know the issue existed. Greater details below on why a miss:
On Jan 10, 2020, we received an order for the ASIN  XXXXX from this customer XXXXXX (Order ID: #XXXXX).
On Feb 25, 2020, the customer XXXXX left a product review that ""book has several missing pages after page 118 till about 132"". This ASIN - XXXXX is not created by us and like other rightful sellers, we placed our offer. We never monitored reviews at a product level.
Since the customer never left a seller feedback or sent us a direct message for the quality issue, we were not aware that we unknowingly gave a bad purchase experience to a customer. We failed because we didnt have a mechanism to track/monitor product reviews for ASINs we sell.
In our previous analysis, we did not dive deep enough, consequently we missed checking the product reviews. Last week, we conducted a more detailed investigation of this ASIN - XXXXX & manually checked all the 36 product reviews, cross verify customer names on each of these against the customer names of all 193 orders fulfilled by us for this ASIN & identified that issue was with order ID: #1XXXXX.
 Greater detail on actions you have taken to Resolve
We have deleted the listing  XXXXX & placed removal of the remainder inventory of this ASIN in FBA. We empathize with the customer & made a full refund to them. We will not relist this ASIN until the associated product authenticity issues are resolved at root cause.
Clear Picture of Invoice: We purchased XXX units of the ASIN - XXXXX for the FBA shipment ID- XXXXX shipped on Dec 17, 2019 & have attached a clear picture of the invoice (No. XXXXX) for procurement of these 85 units.
Total quality program (TQP): We have redefined our quality control process as per Educational Publishers Enforcement Group (EPEG). EPEG is the gold standard for book sellers globally when defining selling QC processes and weeding out any inauthentic copies. We have dedicated two champions from our team for the program- Quality Assurance (QA) Manager and a Quality Control (QC) analyst. Both the employees have 3+ years experience and are Six-Sigma Certified. QC Analysts work will be monitored/reviewed/measured by the QA Manager who directly reports into me. We have also signed up with NEW TOOL NAME to track product quality metrics for all our inventory.
Product Check : For all incoming inventory, the QC Analyst will check page numbers (should be sequential), correct running heads, typographical standards & text/image opacity as per guidelines mentioned on EPEG website. He will daily report observations on ASIN level check sheets on Salesforce Compliance Quest.
Corrective and preventative action (CAPA) process : The QA Manager will drive continuous Improvement by performing routine/mystery audit on QAs work & be a 2nd level check to eliminate false negatives/positives. I will directly monitor/review QA Managers via set dashboards on Salesforces tool.
Feedback loop : We have defined process failure points on Salesforce that account for frequent errors and a feedback loop between QA Manager QC Analyst. A weekly feedback loop will tighten up any inefficiencies early on.
Measuring key metrics for evaluating overall process performance : We will measure two metrics on a daily/weekly/monthly basis (i) Total #of defects identified (ii) #of defects by supplier. This will be routinely benchmarked against the industry standards & we will not work with suppliers with product defect rate >1%.
Resolving source of Defective unit : We checked with our supplier who has confirmed that this is not an authenticity issue but a handling issue of some lot of books because of high seasonal sales volume. We assert that this is first quality issue instance we have faced with this supplier. We have advised our supplier to incorporate more robust quality process to avoid such circumstances in future. Also, our new Total quality program (TQP) is equipped to weed out such defects at our end.
We have also reviewed our inventory and compared it with our recent procurement and can assure that there are no additional authenticity issues with the rest of our inventory.
 Greater detail on the steps you have taken to prevent this issue from happening in the future
Monitoring Product Reviews on ASINs: While we have necessary tools and mechanisms to track seller feedback and direct customer messages daily, we are evaluating tools to track product level reviews. We are planning to go live with https://www.bqool.com/review-central/ that will give us daily report of product reviews of ASINs where we have placed an offer. This will be monitored against the orders we have fulfilled. This should help us mitigate bad reviews & initiate timely interventions to minimize any -ve impact on CX. Also, we will continue following our present 24-hour SLA to solve any customer concerns.
Detailed Supplier Audit: Just to double check, we are re-auditing of all our suppliers by screening against the OFAC, BIS, and SDN websites & validating their supply chain with brand owners. This should weed out any possible bad actors. Moving forward a compulsory Audit of all suppliers will be conducted at end of every quarter.
Reading Section 3 of Amazon Services Business Solutions Agreement: We read Section 3 in detail & understand that Amazon can suspend a seller account if the seller is involved in any deceptive or fraudulent, or illegal activity. We can confirm that we have never indulged in any such unethical business practices & never violated amazon Policies.
We have reviewed the Amazon Anti-Counterfeiting Policy https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/201165970 & will train our team every quarter on most recent Amazon policies & also conduct post training quizzes to test the trainings effectiveness.
We have fulfilled XXXXX+ orders since inception (2018) & received ZERO Product Policy Violations/rights owner complaints. We have consistently maintained highest level of seller compliance & our perfect account health is a testimony to this. This is the very first product authenticity case for us. However, we continue taking full responsibility of the miss as it completely slipped by & as a seller, we did not meet amazons bar. We are also confident that introduction of the new product quality process & other corrective steps should eliminate defective products before they slip into any of our shipments. We also confirm that we will not be married to this new process & will continue to experiment, iterate, and improve.
We look forward to resume selling on Amazon & deliver highest level of customer satisfaction.

Dear Amazon Seller Support,
I, Daly E-commerce, have received an email that my account has been deactivated from listings may be unauthentic items. Thank you for allowing me to write a Point of Action letter to explain where I went wrong and what my future business method will entail to continue to comply with Amazon Policies from here on out if you reinstate my sellers account.
A. What was the root cause that led to the issue?
Amazon has stated that 3 ASINS in my inventory may be inauthentic. After reading through amazons policies and seller university, I have realized that Daly E-commerce did not comply with Amazons Product Authenticity and Quality Policy. Our ignorance to read the policy thoroughly has caused the suspension of our account and we take full responsibility.
Where we went wrong:
We do not have invoices for our items as we purchased them when there are incoming orders. I now understand that Amazon wants every seller to have inventory on hand and accurately state the quantity before they list those said items.
We never attempted to receive an authorization letter before displaying the products on our store because we were unaware that we needed them. Amazon wants to protect the consumers and the rights owners, so every seller should have the proper documentation to list brands and use suppliers and manufacturer to prove a valid supply chain.
I never attempted a quality check on brands and products. Amazon wants every product to be looked at and remove all third party paperwork so that the seller is the seller of record on the documents.
I am aware that we were entitled to read and understand all policy and business agreements prior to selling on Amazon. It was also a mistake of mine to not read through Seller University for continued education.
With this suspension it has made me reevaluate my business practices as a whole to have a successful ethical future in the e-commerce business with Amazon.
B. What actions will we take to resolve the issue?
I deleted and closed all listings including the 3 ASINs you reached out to me about from our inventory to have a new approach to selling on amazon.
Reread all of the Amazon policies and business agreements to make sure I fully understand how to comply.
Refunded every customer that has bought the ASIN on the list.
Created a check list to go through before listing products and proving authentication.
Went over my business method and decided that FBA would be a better approach. I would like to sell authorized wholesale authentic items through FBA. This will prevent future issues of shipping, storage and inventory.
C. What steps will you take to prevent future issues?
If I get reinstated, Fulfillment by Amazon is our new business model.
Find reliable suppliers by contacting them individually to get quotes and to learn their terms of service and requirements.These suppliers must allow selling on Amazon so there is no conflict and provide a letter of authentication that states and gives me permission to sell their product/products on Amazon under my store, Daly E-commerce.
Complete a personal check list before listing a product that meets all the requirements to comply with Amazon Product and Quality policy.
This checklist will include: research of products, learning their terms of service, receiving an authorization letter from supplier that allows Daly E-Commerce to sell their items, making sure details of the product page on Amazon are accurate.
I also will need to verify authenticity of the products I source and check for quality.
Organize and store all documentation, records of transactions, to be prepared in the future if I need to verify my listings.
If I am unsure about something, make sure to reach out to seller forums or Amazon themself to help educate myself more on that said issue before taking any action.
I am aware of where Daly E-Commerce was wrong in its business model and take full responsibility.
Please consider re-instating my Amazon Seller account.",Account Health

1554,Suggestions for Appeal & POA,"Does anyone have any suggestions or input on this appeal/plan of action:
Dear Amazon,
I am responding to my account suspension concerning this account being related to another account that may not be used to sell on Amazon.
Root Cause:
After investigating, I have found that one of my old email addresses, xxxx@oldemail.com, was registered for Seller Central. This old email address was likely registered using my current cell phone number and/or SSN. The old email address has been inactive and inaccessible for approximately 10 years. To my knowledge, that account was not used to actually sell anything on Amazon.
Actions Taken to Resolve the Issue:
I contacted the ISP related to my old email address to see if there are options to reactivate the account so I may retrieve the OTP.
The ISP no longer supports email accounts, as of August 19, 2019.
How I will prevent this issue from happening again:
I have added OTP verification by text message on my new account, so that a similar lockout does not occur.
The new accounts business payment information, and product listings are materially different from the old account.
Thank you.",Account Health

1556,Amazon Destroys One More Small Business NOT BY SUSPENSION Please Read,"Got another Performance Notification Today. I say another because I thought we had seen it all until this. Amazon just destroyed our business and it was NOT over Performance.

1559,A sticky situation - advice please,"Hello everyone.
I have been selling for almost 6 years on Amazon in the Fine Jewelry category (current account is new as Im with a different company now). For 5+ years of that I managed a home-grown brand that was in the Brand Registry.
Recently I decided to list what is called a jewelry finding (a component used to make jewelry, categorized under Arts, Crafts and Sewing > Beading and Jewelry Making and NOT in Jewelry).
I made a list of my suppliers and the exact products offered, down to tenth of a mm sizes.
I searched for applicable listings on Amazon to determine where to list these products. I specifically:
recorded each ASIN with its exact product specifications and pricing
ran a test to determine whether each ASIN was in the Brand Registry (it is common for sellers to make their own listings, and you have to check carefully to figure out which are really generic vs. branded), specifically by entering in the ASIN on Add a Product and checking if there were listing restrictions
of those that did not have restrictions (other than, say, listing only new condition), checking the USPTO website to see if those not-protected-by-Amazon brand names were in fact trademarked to sell in the jewelry findings class (a trademark in one class does not grant protection in another class)
of the remaining, I carefully compared the specifications in the listing to that of my vendors before narrowing down to the exact ASINs to list on
I know that most people go no further than #2, because if Amazon doesnt list a restriction, it is highly likely there isnt a trademark involved. Ive been working on trademarking a brand, so I am a tad hypersensitive to trademark infringement.
Before purchasing inventory, I:
Created the actual offers on the listings to confirm I could sell on them (I gave a future available date after I would receive ordered inventory)
Allowed a couple of days to go by to see if any red flags were raised
Purchased the inventory
Received, sorted and packaged the inventory
Clicked Activate to make my listings go live
Started advertising campaigns to support my new listings
Began fulfilling orders when they started trickling in
This is what I call due diligence. I do this for every listing. I have a few brands I sell that are trademarked and I buy direct from the manufacturer, and even though I am not required to, I send them my listing copy before I go live on a listing.
So imagine my shock and horror this morning when I received a message stating that I had been reported to Amazon Brand Registry for listing on a trademarked brand.
After I got over feeling very sick to my stomach (I still feel a little sick after 14 hours), I engaged in a conversation with the seller. No, do not ask, I will not give out information on the seller or the ASINs as the point of this topic is to get help for a peaceful resolution and NOT to bully or malign anyone.
I have been professional, stuck to the facts, been logical, and done additional research to try and figure out how this happened. I have shared how I came to be listed on those ASINs and what I did to make sure this didnt happen with the seller. I have gone back to the USPTO site and further researched the sellers claims, and shared what I found with the seller. I have proposed a kind way for us to both back out of this situation in a way that would protect both businesses and give the seller what they wanted - me off their listings.
This all gets sticky because the research on the USPTO site revealed that the seller isnt using their trademark exactly as registered - of all the silly things because the seller removed a . from their registered trademark (generally punctuation doesnt matter, but in this case the USPTO would not approve the sellers trademark until the seller revised their mark to include the .). This means that in order to defend my business from a false accusation I would have to reveal to Amazon that the seller isnt actually using their mark as actually registered, and provide them with the sellers USPTO documents that are available for all to see on the USPTO site. Public information that might detrimentally affect the sellers business.
Add to that the mark isnt registered in the class for jewelry findings, so there isnt any trademark protection anyway.
How do I convey to the seller that I have been frank, open, sincere, and truthful? That I have taken what the seller has said and investigated to find out if somehow I had actually infringed on a trademark? That I learned that according to the letter of the law, I have not infringed, but that I want to honor the spirit of the law and have a safe way to exit from the listings with my business intact?
My efforts to date have simply made this enraged seller, well, more enraged. Now I am getting long lists of case law from the seller that supposedly supports that it doesnt matter that the . is missing (the seller avoids talking about the fact that there is no trademark protection in jewelry findings; the seller did list the item incorrectly in the Jewelry category - I only know that as Amazon overcharged the referral fee at 20% instead of the 15% fee for items that are jewelry findings).
The cases the seller provided are interesting as they have nothing to do with the seller omitting the . I actually took the time to read up on those cases, and every single one of them was about the fact that adding punctuation to a mark after approved registration is usually allowed. This situation is the seller deleting a punctuation mark that the USPTO required the seller to include in the mark as a condition for approval.
I really want this to be resolved without harm to myself or the other seller. I have not taken umbrage at the seller addressing me as if I am scum. I have even tried to help the seller by encouraging the use of the actual registered trademark and suggesting adding  2020 [registered trademark] to every listing.
I need advice. Let me rephrase that. I need advice that assumes that I actually did everything I described here and that my statements are factual and accurate - advice in good faith. If you feel the need to accuse me of things, feel free, but dont expect a response from me.
The seller has made it clear that even if I remove my offers the seller will proceed with action through Amazon. In other words, my only leverage to achieve a safe exit from this situation without revealing damaging information to Amazon about the sellers misuse of their trademark is to not remove my offers until I reach an agreement with the seller. If Im willing for seller to be harmed, I will have no problem successfully defending myself given the public USPTO documents. But I sincerely dont even want to risk harm coming to the seller, and the seller has no clue I am actually a decent human being.
Please, I sincerely need advice.
My post is very long because it is my experience that fellow forum sellers get annoyed when they have to ask for additional information because the OP provided insufficient information for them to give good and useful advice. I am trying to be respectful of the need for sufficient information.",Account Health
1560,Product Authenticity and the Word K-Cup,"Hi all,
Looking for some advice on what my best move is here. I am not suspended but I have received a strike on my account that I am desperate to get removed. Two days ago I received a trademark infringement for a listing that used the word k-cup in the title. I didnt know at the time, but K-cup is a trademarked term owned by Keurig and can only be used in listings in specific ways so as to not confuse customers. Here is the original email I received:
We are contacting you because we received a report of trademark infringement on the product detail page associated with one or more of your listings. Sellers on Amazon.com are not allowed to use trademarked terms in a way that might lead their product to be confused with a different trademarked product.
Please modify your product and product detail page to ensure they do not infringe on the trademark of the rights owner listed below.
Examples of unacceptable terms:
 AmazonBasics speaker charging cable. AmazonBasics is trademarked by Amazon.
 Wireless Amazon speaker for laptop. Amazon is trademarked by Amazon.
 Cable similar to Pinzon. Pinzon is trademarked by Amazon, and we prohibit the use of similar to.
Examples of acceptable terms:
 Cable for charging AmazonBasics speaker. The cable is not created or sold by Amazon.
 Wireless speaker for laptop, compatible with AmazonBasics. The speaker is not created by Amazon.
 Basic cable works with Pinzon. The cable is not sold or created by Pinzon.

ASIN: XXXXXXXX
Title: XXXXXX k cup
Trademark: 2431816
Complaint ID: 6808370191
Sincerely,
Amazon Seller Performance""
The listing was deleted by Amazon and I no longer had access to the listing. In a panic I sent in this appeal:
Greetings Seller Support Team,
I have received notification that ASIN: XXXXXX has received a report of trademark infringement on the product detail page associated with one or more of my listings. This is related to Trademark: 2431816, which is the term K-CUP owned by KEURIG GREEN MOUNTAIN INC.
This particular ASIN received a violation because the title of the listing violated Amazons policy in regards to using a trademarked term. The item for sale was NOT related to Keurig, and using the term K-CUP in the title may cause confusion as to the source, endorsement, or affiliation of the goods.
Corrective Action
After reviewing Amazons Intellectual Property Policy for Sellers, I have done the following to be in line with Amazons policy.
The listing has been deleted and closed
Once the listing is re-instated, I will remove K-CUP from the title and replace it with Compatible with Keurig which meets Amazons acceptable terms.
Preventive Action
To prevent this from happening in the future, I will make sure to more carefully ensure that listings I am selling on are NOT using trademarked terms. If they are, I will not sell on that listing or I will edit them to say Compatible with X, where X is the trademarked term. This falls in line with Amazons acceptable terms.
I have gone through my entire inventory and made edits to additional inventory that may be in violation of Amazons Intellectual Property Terms. Any use of the word K-CUP has been changed to K-CUP COMPATIBLE
I have thoroughly reviewed Amazons Intellectual Property Terms and Conditions and will continue to do so on a regular basis.
I apologize for my violation and look forward to having this IP Complaint removed from my account.
Thank you so much for your time.
Amazon did not accept this appeal and told me to edit the listing, even though I no longer had access to it. Luckily, I was able to get Seller Support on the phone and had assistance re-opening the listing and making the needed changes. The listing is NO longer in violation of any trademark claims. However, upon submitting the additional information to the appeal to let them know that the issue is solved, they elevated the issue and are now requesting proof of authenticity. Here is the email:
Hello,

Strangely, they left the ASIN out of this email. But anyways, Ill be honest, this is an item from Trader Joes and I only have the receipt as my proof of authenticity. Every single seller on Amazon of Trader Joes products would only have a receipt if they encountered this, no invoice.

1561,Competitor placing THOUSANDS of orders and cancelling to sabotage,"I just received an email from the seller-performance team about misuse of ratings or sales rank and my account will be suspended if it continues. I had no clue what caused it so I some digging on my account. I noticed thousands of cancelled orders 2-5 minutes apart (probably a automated bot) over the last few days. (max. order quantity is set to 2)
Someone is placing an order every 2-5 minutes and cancelling the order before it goes through. I cant see who the person is because the order never goes through, it just goes right to cancelled status.

1570,Listings Attacked with Multiple Fake Infringement Complaints,"Fake infringement complaints are nothing new around here, but whats crazy is that once you resolve them, you would think Amazon would block the bad actor from continuing to file fake infringement complaints. NOPE! This should be a warning to all Amazon sellers that Amazon does little to protect you sellers from fraudulent, fake infringement complaints.
I first received the fake infringement complaint on March 15. Shortly after I reached out to the owner of the IP, and they confirmed that brandprotection.org 11 does not represent them. It took me 2 weeks, even with proof and contact from the legitimate rights owner to get my listing restored. Then 3 days later, brandprotection.org 11 files another fake infringement complaint and Amazon accepts the complaint and takes down my listing again!! How is it that Amazons Notice Dispute doesnt blacklist these bad actors and allow them to continue to make fake, fraudulent IP complaints!
The fake complainant doesnt even have to list a valid trademark or patent number for Amazon to accept the complaint! See attachment the registration listing in the complaint doesnt even need a valid number for Amazon to accept the complaint from the bad actor.
I hope sellers take notice and think twice about making the Amazon platform their main revenue source. Amazon does not lookout for their sellers against such bad actors. At the minimum, they should be checking to see if the trademark or patent registration is legitimate.
I hope @Cecilia_Amazon, @Cassie_Amazon, @Katie_Amazon will take this up to the relevant departments because Notice Dispute is not doing anything about these fraudulent IP complaints.",Account Health

1572,Help with our POA for inauthentic items,"Dear Seller Performance,
Thank you for this chance to respond to my recent suspension for inauthentic items. We accept full responsibility for not understanding and listing items without brand authorization. We want to be compliant with Amazons policies and to provide Amazons customers with a positive experience. We appreciate the opportunity to work with you to resolve this quickly and are committed to take all necessary actions to correct the problem.
Upon hours of research and talking to other sellers, because we are new Seller in Amazon environment we understand the problem with not being able to provide satisfactory evidence of a valid supply chain and the rights to resell branded items.
Root cause:
After applying to sell these products on Amazon, I was automatically approved and was able to list these items without submitting any documentation. I now know that this did not give me the right to list those products. I also did not properly source my inventory from a reputable distributor. I added three products to my listings which was purchased at Bed Bath & Beyond. I received a receipt for my purchase. The products that I had purchased from Bed Bath and Beyond, were not defected or damaged. The products were the same as described on Amazon. I received the email from amazon in regards to my account being temporarily deactivated due to offering items that may be inauthentic, minutes after selling one of the questionable items in my listings. I did not receive any customer complaints in regards to the products being inauthentic.
Although we sell authentic products and provided all the receipts for those items showing authenticity, we accept responsibility for this mistake in understanding.
I do not have brand authorization letters; I can only provide my receipts for proof of purchase. I verified that the retailer is an authorized distributor of those brands.
With this new understanding, we would like to present our plan of action to address the problem.
A. The issue that caused the suspension:
We purchased products from a distributor and automatically assumed we had brand authorization from Brand Owner and Amazon.
B. Steps taken to resolve the complaint:
Since the suspension, we have deleted every single one of our listing, from our Amazon marketplace.
 We have reviewed several Amazon seller policies and fully understand what we did wrong and this will ensure that we will not repeat this mistake.
These reviewed policies include the Seller Agreement, Amazon Services Business Solution Agreement, Prohibited Seller Activities and Listing Restrictions, Restricted Products Policy, Amazons Product Safety and Compliance Guidelines, Trade of Endangered Species,"" Intellectual Property Violations Policy"" Anti-Counterfeiting Policy, Offensive and Controversial Products, Category and Product Restrictions and Policy Violations
All future listings will be measured against these policies in order to make sure that we only list authentic items.
 We have permanently deleted all of our listings for these ASINs and related ASINs or products from Amazon to ensure that this problem will never occur again.
 We blocked these ASINs and related ASINS and products in our in-house inventory management software, so that these products will never be listed again without the prior authorization from the original manufacturer.
 We have purged our entire inventory on Amazon, pulled an All Listing inventory report, and audited our listings and inventory to confirm the authenticity of all our items to ensure this wont happen again.
 We have ceased working with unauthorized distributors and suppliers. Remaining distributors and suppliers were examined to determine authenticity and authorization of other products sold.
C. What we have done to prevent similar complaints in the future:
 The actions we have taken in step B will prevent any problems from occurring in the future.
 We have developed a system to prevent the buying, listing, and selling of any product containing the intellectual property belonging to another party and will not proceed without authorization from that party and Amazon.
 We have developed a strict procedure for new suppliers and retailers that we consider working with in the future. This procedure will ensure authenticity of products and authorization from the original manufacturer.
 Should any doubts remain about inauthentic items, we have created a policy to consult with the Amazon Seller Performance Team and the original manufacturer before listing the products. We will not buy, list, or sell any items whose authenticity we cannot establish.
We have stopped working with every supplier who doesnt have legal authorization and certificates for the products in question.
We shall aggressively monitor our listings to ensure we continue meeting the standards set by Amazon and our own standards of quality customer service.
D. Supplier information
I were diligently focused on my business, but were ignorant of my account issues, and lack of sourcing items in a timely manner, this caused my current situation and I have implemented a new policy and procedures for my selling account.
I have educated myself to ensure my full compliance. Please find my receipts, images of my products and full supplier information attached.
I look forward to your review and favorable decision, allowing me to continue selling on the Amazon marketplace.

1574,Any hopes in getting my account reinstated?,"Hey Fellows,
Like many other in here have been dealing with the following:
Cause:
Back in January opened the NA account by mistaken via my personal Amz Account email (+ bank details-debit card) when I was prompted from the Global Selling Dash.
Been charged fees straight away and right after got suspended. Shortly I opened a case explaining the situation and requested the closure of the account since my intention was not to use it in any circumstances.
The account has been inactive ever since. However recently tried to open the NA account using my Seller account email via Global Selling. Obviously been charged fees and the account has been deactivated in accordance with section 3 of Amazons Business Solutions Agreement. If you currently sell on Amazon, we need additional documentation to verify your payment methods and your identity.
In order to reinstate my account need to provide additional documents which must be authentic and unaltered.
 A business license, if applicable.
 A bill that is dated within the last 90 days for piped or natural gas, electricity, piped water, or internet service with name and address visible.
How do I reactivate my account?
Please confirm that there is a valid credit card on file, and provide the requested document(s) in .pdf, .png, .jpeg, or .gif format.
After 3 unsuccessful appeals, finally manage to get through the Account Health team to explain how the situation escalated and recommended the only way to get my 1st account reinstated upon verification than try to appeal and submit a POA for my actual account that I intend to use.
While already been validated by other marketplace I still need to provide the docs necessary to prove my identity for NA. Which does not make any sense at all!
Actions:
I live in a shared property, therefore the bills are not under my name, except the cell phone bill which was rejected. When asked about the business license (if applicable) they could not give me a straight answer. Is a business trade mark or a self employed certificate issued by the GOV. being considered valid in the lack of a utility bill under my name and address.
Further Steps:
Is it worth uploading these docs since there is no clarity in terms of a accepted business license docs and get my account reinstated, close it again and get the other one up and running?
If not are there any alternatives left?
Before submitting the docs, shall I change the payment methods to my credit card details instead of the current debit card displayed.
All documents, bank statements, national ID match my name and address letter by letter.
I am now in this vicious circle that I feel have no way out and wondering still worth it to go ahead or not.
Your feedback and suggestions would be much appreciated.

1580,Hello I need help with My POA,"Hello I need some help with My POA. I received an email from Amazon :
Hello,
Thank you for submitting your appeal. We reviewed the information you submitted and determined that it is missing the following information. Please include the missing information listed below in your plan of action:
Thank you for submitting your appeal. We reviewed the information you submitted and determined that the corrective action items you have listed have not been implemented. Please make sure all corrective actions have been completed to be in compliance with your plan of action:
We have implemented more stringent requirements to sell health and wellness products, disinfecting products (including sanitizers, wipes, or sprays), and grocery products such as canned goods in our store. As a result, some of your listings may not be reinstated.
 Greater detail on the root cause(s) of the {Price gouging}.
 Greater detail on the actions you have taken to resolve the identified issues.
 Greater detail on the steps you have taken to prevent {Price gouging} going forward.
Has your account been deactivated in error?
If you believe there has been an error, please tell us why. Your explanation should include the following information:
 How your listing(s) have not violated Amazons selling policies.
 How are you able to ensure you currently and in future do not violate Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy.
This was POA: Not sure what I did wrong here:
The root causes.
 I engaged in price gauging by setting a price of $6.98 - $24.89 and expedited shipping of $19.99. I priced this unfairly to increase my revenue. I now understand that the price was significantly higher than other prices offered on Amazon, therefore I violated the Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy.
 At that time, I believe the price point was around $8.99-$11.98 plus shipping if charged. I thought pricing at $6.98-$24.89 was ok because my delivery dates were sooner than other sellers. But now I understand that I did not adhere to the Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy that states this rules:
Setting a reference price on a product or service that misleads customers.
Setting a price on a product or service that is significantly higher than recent prices offered on or off Amazon.
Setting a shipping fee on a product that is excessive. Amazon considers current public carrier rates, reasonable handling charges, as well as buyer perception when determining whether a shipping price violated our fair pricing policy.
 I failed to read Amazon Fair Pricing Policy guidelines and applicable laws regarding the pricing of items on Amazons marketplace. I take full responsibility for this issue and would like to share my plan of action, which describes how I will prevent this from happening again.
 I also take full responsibility for the Pricing Multi-Pack abuse. The policy states that Selling multiple units of a product for more per unit than that of a single unit of the same product is abusing the policy. This is what happened to me; one example of a mistake I made: (the original prices)
 ASIN: B0874XFLGP 50/CS for $59.99
ASIN: B0872SX5XM 50/CS for $53.99
ASIN: B0869BD1XD 10/CS for $13.50
ASIN: B086YXHKPV 20/CS for $19.98
Based on the correct price of ASIN: B086YXHKPV 20/CS for $19.98
The other ASIN as a Multi-pack offer sale should have been like this
 ASIN: B0874XFLGP 50/CS for $49.95 instead of $59.99
ASIN: B0872SX5XM 50/CS for $49.95 instead of $59.99
ASIN: B0869BD1XD 10/CS for $9.99 instead of $13.50
-Actions you have taken to resolve the identified issues.
 With immediate effect, I have now closed and deleted all ASIN listings I sell. I will wait and start from the beginning with the correct prices and not violate any policies.
 I will source from manufacturers or authorized distributors so I can make sure that my price is competitive with prices offered on and off Amazon.
 I refunded the expedited shipping fee to the clients.
 Daily price checks will take place for every active ASIN in my inventory. This includes Fix Price Alerts and if a product is at the buy box price and still showing the status Inactive (Blocked) I will close and delete the listing.
 I have carefully reviewed all Amazon policies, guidelines and help pages, especially the ones regarding the pricing practices sellers should follow on Amazons marketplace. I have understood all the requirements to maintain my seller account fully complaint and educated myself about the pricing practices the seller should be aware of.
 With immediate effect, I refunded the extra amount paid for the ASIN mentioned above to the clients.
 From now on the correct price will be charged depending on how much one item is priced to offer a multi-pack to avoid the Pricing Multi-Pack Abuse.
 If reinstated I will use this suspension as a learning curve to better my business, implement more systems and to provide the customers of Amazon the best possible service.
Steps you have taken to prevent price gouging going forward.
Going forward, when I list a new product, I will make sure to verify the recent prices on Amazon and other platforms. Once I gather this information based on the product, I will make sure to match or price below each item. Also making sure that if I have a Multi-pack sale to offer it accordingly to the Policies.
My expedited shipping fee will be changed to the default price $8.99 not $19.99 like I had it. (Amazon considers current public carrier rates, reasonable handling charges, as well as buyer perception when determining whether a shipping price violated our fair pricing policy.)
As I keep growing my inventory, I will apply Automate Pricing rules to my listings to adjust my prices and stay fair.
I will contact Amazon Seller Central support when I am not clear on policies.
I have read the Amazon Marketplace Fair pricing Policy and watched Products requiring approval Seller performance Product authenticity and Amazon Automate Pricing to learn more about the platform and therefore prevent any issues moving forward.
I will continue to set aside 1 day a week to review and study amazons policies and updates.
Please consider reinstating my account. I accept full responsibility for my mistake.",Account Health

 Greater detail on how your account has complied with our policy; and
 Greater detail on evidence or examples that demonstrate that your account has complied with our policy.
This is my POA:
What Went Wrong, Root Cause of Issue
Priced items that violated the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy.
Almost all our orders are typically FBA, mainly in the toy section. With the current global situation regarding COVID-19, had to adapt to and expand our FBM model and expand our product offerings. Some of these new offerings, mostly health items, are new to our product assortment.
Did not properly research the pricing history for the ASINs in question.
Priced the ASINs competitively to sellers already with a listing for the ASINs without doing the proper research on the pricing history. Used a similar formula for profit margin as utilized on our FBA items, which is around 30%.
The ASINs were priced using cost of goods plus shipping into one price. Did not utilize shipping templates.
What We Have Done to Fix the Problems
We have removed any listing that did not comply with the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy.
We have updated the pricing for all similar ASINs to better reflect the current market prices.
Read and reviewed Fair Pricing/ Pricing Your Item https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/62551 1 and Policies and Agreements (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/521 1)
C. What we have done to prevent the problems from happening again in the future
Implemented a daily task of checking account/pricing dashboard for any violations. If any are found, the ASIN listing would immediately be deleted while we follow up on the cause.
Research pricing on various other platforms and retailers (eBay, Walmart, Target, Walgreens) to offer the best price possible. If it is found that we are not competitively priced, adjustments will be made.
Make use of shipping templates to better reflect the fair market value selling price of the item plus the shipping cost that would include shipping costs and packing supplies.
All the above steps will help make certain that our account complies with Amazon policy.
Any advice, good or bad, is welcomed. Thanks!",Account Health
1582,Account Deactivated-Please Help,"Hello,
I have 2 issues I am trying to clear up, both I believe to be errors. First, Amazon is questioning the authenticity of some of the merchandise I am offering, It is coming from a verifiable wholesale supplier and I have provided what invoices I could to show the authenticity of the merchandise. The second issue was 100% my mistake in listing a product incorrectly (I added my shipping cost and 15% Amazon fees into my selling price and offered free shipping, and it made the price appear excessive, price gouging. I want to delete or at least edit it to make it be in compliance but I dont know how when it is no longer in my inventory.
My last POA letter I sent with additional invoices was on 4/20. I received an email thanking me and saying they would update my account with the new info I provided but I have heard nothing and I am still deactivated. Below is the POA letter I sent. I responded to the listing issue through seller central in Account Health, but have heard nothing about that either.
Any help or guidance you can give me will be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

First, I would like to sincerely apologize for my actions that have led to this happening. I assumed that since I was an authorized reseller of the entire catalog of Bangalla Organic Wholesales products, that I could list these and that was a mistake. I completely understand you needing to verify the authenticity of the products I am selling and the wholesaler I purchase them from.
I am providing these additional invoices from Bangalla Organics, the wholesale supplier I get the merchandise in question from ( ASIN B004KU2RYI Field Day Tissue, and ASIN B00J5HDM7W Biokleen Floor Cleaner) showing that I purchase and resell from Bangalla not only those brands (Biokleen) but other brands as well Natures Way vitamin products, San Francisco Bay Coffee, and health and beauty products (Andalou Naturals) all coming from Bangalla. I have nothing else I can provide to show the authenticity of the merchandise Bangalla Organics sells wholesale.
I do not have an invoice for the 2 specific products in question because I havent sold them yet, I only listed them. I do not hold inventory of these or any products, I was trying to see which items I can compete on and sell. When I can identify those products, I will order them in bulk and ship them into your warehouses and do FBA. At least that was my plan, I certainly did not intend to violate any policies and I apologize if my understanding is wrong. I should have reached out to you before I tried to list them to see what you would require. When I first tried to list the Biokleen, I had to request approval, which I was given with one click, so I never thought there would be an issue. From my best understanding of Amazons policy, I am allowed to dropship these items on your platform because they (really) are authentic and they come from a verifiable wholesale supplier and there are no invoices, packing slips or external packaging included indicating a seller name or contact information other than my own.
Please contact Oscar Flores, General Manager of Bangalla Organics to verify the information is accurate and correct. His direct phone line is (425)369-9209; Oscar@bangalla.com is his email. With everything going on with the coronavirus, he is so busy that it can be hard to get him on the phone but he will definitely respond to email. You could also go to the wholesale website www.bangalla.com 2 , search for the products and find them to see that they are authentic.
I sincerely apologize for all the confusion, please let me know what you would like me to do next. If you determine that I can no longer sell on Amazon, I understand. However, I really dont believe I have violated any policies and you can verify everything so I do ask that you release the money being held in my account, that is rightfully mine as I did fulfill all those orders. If all those cases of Name Brand toilet paper from Bangalla I sold and fulfilled were inauthentic, or there was some issue, you would have heard from the customers by now, its been over 3 weeks.
Thank you for your consideration,

1584,Trouble reinstating my NA account after my EU and JP accounts are in good standing,"Hi all,
I am a new Amazon seller, and this is my first post. I accidentally signed up for global selling when registered for NA account. As a result my account was suspended shortly after i got approved because of related accounts. I have read up all the relevant threads on the forum, and got a good understanding that I need to resolve my EU and JP account first. I spent the past 2 months and finally got my EU and JP account reactivated and are both in good standing.
Here is my question. After my EU and JP accounts are reactivated, I then tried to appeal on my NA account. But I still did not get any success. Below is the answer I got from NA on April 27. Please note, in this appeal i did not attach any document, but merely stated the fact that I have reinstated my EU and JP accounts.

Thank you for helping me to appeal my seller accounts suspension
Our account was suspended result of Amazons artificial intelligence algorithm malfunction. We are victim of Amazon IP infringement case loses to Christian Louboutin. We never sold any of the shoes that actually identify by Christian Louboutin as IP violation. The suspected IP violation items in questions are all Suspected IP violation, which were flagged by Amazon AI by mistake. Christian Louboutin trademark is for Red outer sole shoes. Amazon AI flags all colors outer sole as suspected violation! Amazon AI is color blink! We do not wish to fight with Amazon, so we simply accept Amazon AI fault by removed all in question items from out inventory. Our account get suspended because we did nothing initially because the product pages for the items in question were already removed/deleted by Amazon, so we though that was considered removed. We later found out after our account was suspended that Amazon wants us to delete the listing from our inventory. By deduct the inventory to zero or close the listing, does not count as remove. We have to 'Delete"" the items. Other sellers deleted their listing so they did not get suspended. We get suspended because we did not know the proper way to remove those items.

Below is our Plan of Action on resolving the suspected IP violation issue and plan to prevent similar issue from reoccur in the future.
The root cause of the issue:
we are not aware of the new Product Policy Compliance section in
Account Health page. Thus, we were not responding to Product Policy
Compliance notification.
We miss understood that a suspected listing in violation that link to a page not found, still need to be deleted. Closed these listing or zero the inventory is not considered as delete by Amazon.
The actions we have taken to resolve the issue:
We have carefully reviewed our entire Amazon account inventory to make sure all our listing are fully compliant with Amazon policies and deleted all the listings in violation from our store, that including all but not limit to red shoes from all brands we carry that potentially violating patent IC025 US 022 039 filed by Christian Louboutin.
We have black listed all potential patent risk items in our database so they will not be added back by mistake to Amazon in the future.
We will make sure all future new listings been carefully cross checked for IP issues before added to Amazon.
We have contacted all my suppliers to make sure they inform us of all IP related issues timely so I can remove any suspect or potential IP violation product immediately.
We will monitor the new Product Policy Compliance notice closely. Delete or fix all listings associated with the Product Policy Compliance violation.

POA
Root Cause:
Buyer on order 112-xxx- 1865 sent a message stating product looks scratchy/used.
This buyer has purchased multiple items within a one week period and he does not state which item he is concerned about. Buyer has not responded to messages or requested a return. Based on his description of scratches, we believe it is a different ASIN (xxx) he is referring to as this other ASIN often has a scratchy look straight from the manufacturer. We are submitting a POA on that ASIN separately.
This item was received by us on 11/4/2019 and serialized by us as d93642
(Photo of actual item shipped to buyer attached)
Corrective Actions:
We promptly responded to buyer asking for clarification, provided return instructions, and offered refund. (Buyer has taken no follow up action or reply).
I inspected our current inventory of each item this buyer has purchased and looked for abnormal conditions and found none.
Preventative Measures
These items are individually serialized and photographed by us when received. (This is done so we can provide customized selection for buyers, when asked). We are able to determine the exact shipment we received it on and we have an image of the exact items shipped to a buyer.
Products come to us directly from the manufacturers/brand owners.
These products are shipped to buyers in a padded envelope which exceeds the standards used by Amazon for similar products.
We have read and are familiar with Amazon condition requirements and policies.
We do not sell any used items.
Items are visually inspected for abnormalities/mispulls at time of shipping.
We take each customer complaint very seriously. We shipped xxxxx+ disc golf discs on Amazon in the last 90 days.
We received your submission but do not have enough information to reactivate your listings at this time.

Then I replied:
Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team,
We have identified that our account has been suspended due to the need to provide greater detail on evidence or examples that demonstrate that your account has complied with our policy.
We understand that listing restricted items for sale is a serious issue and we have allocated time to:
Analyze our current listings practice
Identify all inauthentic items contained within our listing
Create a new process for listing items to ensure compliance with Amazon policies.
We are now confident that our listings will not violate policies for restricted products or brands.
What We Are Doing To Understand the Issues:
We have reviewed all recent policy violation messages in order to gain a better understanding of the issues relating to the products that we have listed in violation of Amazon policy.
The items were going to be Drop Shipped, following Amazons Drop Shipping policies, where we identify ourselves as the seller of record with our store name on any packing slip or invoices sent to the buyers, and no third-party drop shipper would be identified.
No sales off those have never been made items from our seller account. According to Amazons policies, in order for an item to be deemed inauthentic and such claim be submitted, the complainant should buy the item in question and test it. This did not happen. The purchase of those items would have been made on a as needed basis once the items are sold.
We understand Amazon creates a safe and healthy environment for buyers to buy with confidence. To further address the issue, and be sure we fully understand and abide by the policies, I have reviewed Amazons prohibited seller activities here: [https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/200386250](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?
Furthermore, we have reviewed and fully understood Amazons Anti-Counterfeiting and item Authenticity Policy here: [https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html/]
We have analyzed our listings to understand the cause of policy violations. These can be summarized as follows:
We work closely with our suppliers and have a daily updated list of restricted or inauthentic items.
The restricted items were made inactive in Amazon by setting the available stock to Zero.
Restricted items (previously made inactive by setting stock to zero) were allocated stock by the new system, resulting in restricted items being made active in our account.
We have closed all Amazon listings of inauthentic or restricted items, as opposed to making them out of stock.
We have identified the cause of the issue with restricted items and are now 100% confident that no further policy violations will occur.
Our Proposal for Ensuring Compliance with Amazon Policy:
Close Listing of inauthentic Restricted Items.
We understand that the major issue is removing restricted items listings by closing the listing on Amazon and not making the item out of stock, as we have been doing. This step removes any future risk of restricted items being made in-stock and appearing as listing again.
Regular Review of Restricted Items Policy:
Carry out a regular review of restricted items in Amazon and work with our suppliers and warehouse team to ensure that we have an up to date list of restricted items.
Permanent Closure of New Restricted Product Listings:
Any new products added to the restricted products list, will be immediately closed, in according to the line 1 above.
Carry Out an Impact Assessment On Any New IT Systems / Processes, before launching any new IT system or automating any processing relating to our Amazon.
We will keep record of all business identification forms and transactions with distributor and suppliers should Amazon ever need it.
We will always be transparent in all account activity.
We will only list ASINs that match 100% with the items we are selling.
I would like to thank you for allowing me to explain and helping myself solve this issue. I will always strive to be the best in customer service to our shared customers and will operate my business with integrity and professionalism as I already doing. I hope to be back as soon as possible active.
Sincerely,
Guilherme

The reason is because i made a seller account under my phone number but i couldnt complete my registration because i didnt have a credit card. After i got it, i decided to make another seller under my business email. I used the same phone number and home address on both seller account.They found the link and it got suspended.

1593,Used sold as new complaint- how do I respond when the customer submitted a fraudulent claim?,"I sell power tools, and for one listing we sell battery powered glue gun kits (which included the glue gun, battery, and charger). We have sold hundreds of these kits with no issues, but last week we had a customer requesting a return, and in the return notes they said they tried to charge the battery and it does not charge, and they said the glue gun looks like it has used glue on the tip of it and they believed it may be a refurbished product.
The next day Amazon sent me a message saying they took the listing down and I have to submit a POA / invoices in order for it to be reinstated.
We do also sell these glue gun kits in the Amazon Renewed category (refurbished). I was thinking about how I am going to craft my POA ever since I got the notification. After looking at our processing method and after thinking about how we could have accidentally got a refurbished glue gun in the new box, I concluded the only way it could have happened is if we had a previous customer return, and accidentally shipped the return to the customer who made the recent complaint.
Today we got the return back from the customer in the mail, and I plugged the battery in to test it (since the customer said it did not charge) and I plugged it into the wall and the battery said it had a full charge already. I put the battery into the glue gun, and the glue gun powered up just fine. I examined the glue gun, and could not even find a tiny trace of glue on the tip or any where else. The glue gun did not even have a scratch or blemish. It looked brand new.
It seems to me the customer said it was defective and made a false complaint maybe so we would send a pre paid return label, after approving the return request. They did not even message us about the problem- they just filled out a return request.
I have taken photos of the glue gun and sent them to the customer, politely asking them if they could show us where the glue is or was, so we could improve our Q/C standards. So far the customer has not replied.
So now I am wondering how to craft the POA? We had several similar issues over the past few years, where we have to submit a POA for a used sold as new complaint, and we usually find the source of the problem and come up with a way to prevent it from ever occurring again and that is our POA. But this case is different, because it seems we did everything right in this case. We sent a working battery and charger, and we sent a brand new glue gun. So I am not sure if I should mention this find in my POA or if I should still continue to draft it as us taking the blame.
Just looking for some advise!",Account Health

 Send us a more detailed plan that provides:
 Greater detail on the actions you have taken to resolve your restricted product violations.
 Greater detail on the steps you have taken to ensure that no restricted products are listed on your account in the future.
Here is my reply in which I would like feedback to make sure Im providing amazon with all necessary information. I can also post my previous replies if they would be helpful. Again Im very scared of messing this up and truly appreciate any help you can provide.
Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team,
I received your request for a plan of action regarding a restricted item that was in my inactive inventory. ASIN: B0056Z6MQA, SKU: BK1807, Title: Medieval Spiked Mace Club 35
First off, I want to let you know how much we value your marketplace and take the privilege of selling on your platform, as well as the items we sell on your platform, very seriously, and will do everything possible to address this issue. I apologize that my previous replies did not provide enough information and hope the following will rectify the situation.
What was the root cause that lead to the issue?
I originally found the item in question being sold by our distributor and using your have one to sell button added a listing. In August 2019 I was informed that the listing did not follow Amazons Restricted Products policy, and once notified of this, on August 18th 2019, I changed the inventory of this item to 0, not realizing that changing a listing to 0 stock was not the same as removing the listing. (See picture)
What actions will you take to resolve this issue?
Realizing my mistake, I have now closed all listings for ASIN: B0056Z6MQA using the close listing button in the Manage Inventory section of our seller central account. I would like verification that this process worked, as the items are still showing up in my account even though they have been removed, (See picture)
but when I click the close listing button, it shows I have no listings. (See picture)
What steps will you take to prevent future issues?
We will of course never list this item again, or any other item that may violate Amazons restricted products policy. Before listing any new items, I will continue to check this link https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/200164330 and this link https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html?itemID=200164950 to ensure no new listings are prohibited for sale. I will also stay up to date on these policies by checking the above links at minimum once a month, and verify that the items I have listed are acceptable, as well as continue to regularly access the account health dashboard and my performance notifications in seller central. I also now understand that changing a listing to 0 stock is not the same as deleting the listing, and will now use the close listing option to completely close any listings that are deemed prohibited.
Again, I take this situation very seriously and will do everything in my power to insure that this issue has been rectified and will not happen again. If this is not enough information or the issue has not been adequately addressed, please let me know what else can be done or implemented on my end. Thanks again for allowing me the privilege of selling on your platform.",Account Health

Dear XXX:
Your Amazon selling account is currently under review, and we will be contacting you by phone with more information within 24 hours.

Within the next 24 hours, you will receive a phone call from the Account Health Support team to discuss your account. It is critical that we are able to speak to you to discuss the reasons for the account review and any actions required to continue selling. To ensure we can reach you, please update the phone number listed under Emergency Notifications at this link https://sellercentral.amazon.com/xxx/preferences.
So I called ACCOUNT HEALTH SUPPORT team to see what was going on then the representative told me that I manipulated product review by giving customer coupon or refund to exchange good review.
I was confused and I told her I did a social media promo code and gave it to influencer this month and the promotion already ended. The promo didnt run well, by the way.
She told me that was not the reason and she provided me an ASIN which I never carried to sell or purchased to use in my life. I explained to her and see she pulled the wrong data, then she gave me another ASIN which is my listing.
She told me to look through my message box for last 30 days and see if I ever asked buyer for a good review? Or did I provide coupon, rebate, refund to exchange a good review? (She kept on saying past 30 days)
ErI really didnt do that and out of nowhere they wanna deactivate my account?
She said that was all she can tell me about what is wrong with my account then she created case and sent to my case log.

We received your submission but do not have enough information to reactivate your account at this time. To reactivate your account, please send the following:
 Greater detail on the actions you have taken to resolve buyers not receiving orders or late receipt of orders.
 Greater detail on the steps you have taken to prevent buyers not receiving orders or late receipt of orders going forward.
Here is my second appeal
Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team
Thank you for the opportunity to provide extra detail regards appealing my Seller Accounts suspension due to its Order Defect Rate Exceeding the 1% target.
Greater detail on the root cause(s) of buyers not receiving orders or late receipt of orders.
What happened:
I received several customer complaints in the form of A-Z claims and negative feedbacks complaining about non-receipt of products arriving and poor customer service which consisted of not responding to customers or responding late out of Amazons 24hr timeframe. This was caused by unexpectedly high order volumes, for which I was not properly prepared. Also, it was caused by my failure to use a fast and reliable shipping carrier (which could handle increased seasonal volumes) and non-tracking of items. A fast, tracked and reliable safe shipping carrier would have prevented late receipt and non-receipt of items. I also failed to add customs codes to shipments which could reduce delays in customs checks. I failed to check shipping addresses as some were incorrect, outdated or incomplete within orders arriving in Seller Central. Some did not have a house number ame/ apartment, building, floor or unit number. Only a city, country and post/zip code. These are the root causes for late, missing items and poor customer service.
Greater detail on the actions you have taken to resolve buyers not receiving orders or late receipt of orders.
What I have done to resolve negative issues:
Customer messages received were answered on time within the Amazon 24hr window by myself. I made constant checks twice daily in Seller Central to ensure no messages were missed at 10am and 6pm . All remaining and pending orders were shipped immediately within the exact Amazon shipping dates specified in each order details, in the correct quantities and exactly as described in the listings. Order lists were collated daily at 2pm for order shipping collection at 5pm daily. Shipping addresses were checked to ensure they were correct. If incomplete or incorrect I contacted customers to ensure that the correct details were added to their Amazon Account to ensure each shipment arrived at the correct location. Subsequently labels printed out were checked to ensure they matched the correct shipping address, return address and tracking number were legible, prior to attaching to parcels. Order lists were checked twice daily to ensure orders were processed on time and correctly. Orders were packed and labelled correctly and effectively for collection at 5pm . Tracking numbers and carrier details were sent electronically to each customer on confirmation of shipment within Seller Central after each was checked online to guarantee they were valid. I used a new Priority Airmail Service via Royal Mail with customs information to reduce custom checks queues and detailed location tracking. Throughout transit of each shipment I checked daily on Royal Mail Track and Trace and country USPS Track and Trace to check for safe delivery/attempted delivery. For attempted or no delivery of items I contacted either Royal Mail or country specific postal services (usually USPS) to arrange rescheduled times that was convenient to the customer or confirm the date that the item would be delivered. I relayed this information to the customer. I have researched all available shipping carriers in my country (the UK) to evaluate which ones offer the safest and fastest delivery service to the USA to prevent late receipt and non-receipt complaints. All orders are being sent by an International Priority Airmail with customs codes and tracking included which is a fast and safe tracked and signed for service by Royal Mail. I have monitored their performance for each shipment sent out.
I have read and reread all Amazons policies and help pages including minimum performance standards to ensure I do not violate them again.
Greater detail on the steps you have taken to prevent buyers not receiving orders or late receipt of orders going forward.
What will I do to prevent this from happening again:
From now on, I will send out all orders on time and confirm as shipped within the Expected Ship Date as advised within Seller Central. I will make daily checks on Seller Central to ensure this is actioned and check that shipping addresses are correct, contacting customers if they are not and obtaining the correct details, ensuring customers amend details within their account. Also, I will check shipping labels are printed legible with the correct shipping address. Shipping confirmation will be sent within the shipping dates stated within Seller Central and the ship date, carrier and tracking information will be sent to the customer as soon as the item has been shipped. I will use the International Priority Airmail Royal Mail Tracked Service which is fast, safe and reliable shipping carrier (which includes tracking and signature proof of delivery and customs codes to reduce customs delays) . This will ensure late receipt and non-receipt complaints do not occur. I will communicate with customer via Amazon messages as to parcel location in the transit trail on a daily basis.
As soon as my Seller Account gets reactivated I will increase my Handling Time to reflect any additional time (reviewing at peak seasonal times such as Easter and Christmas) I need to process orders and covers any unexpected delays. This will ensure that customers will have realistic delivery expectations. If I am for any reason not able to fulfil orders my entire account will be set on Holiday Settings. I will regularly review my performance metrics (daily) on Seller Central to verify that I am within Amazons targets. And address any issues with customers immediately should they flag up. Always aiming to have 100% Account Health. All customer messages will be answered on time. All orders shipped and confirmed as dispatched on time . I will make twice daily checks for customer messages and respond on checking immediately.

1604,Longterm damage if its found that our Amazon prices are higher than other marketplaces?,"In an effort to keep up with orders, despite a short staff, we were forced to raise some of our prices. We made every attempt to ensure that we did this in accordance with prices in our other marketplaces but one marketplace slipped through the cracks and we received an alert stating that our price in another marketplace was lower - we promptly corrected this.
We want to again raise prices to keep up with demand/short staff but are concerned of the impact this may have if we fail to adjust in another marketplace.
I am curious to know if there are any longterm implications if we get too many of these alerts, even if we correct them immediately? Could our entire seller account be put in jeopardy?",Account Health
1605,Deactivated seller account,"I had a seller account but requested it to be deleted as I didnt foresee using Amazon seller again, the rep said this first account had been deactivated.
A year later, I tried to open up another account with a different email since the support agent told me when I closed the first one that I would have to use a completely different email account next time if I wanted to use Amazon seller again. Well just as I finished up the registration with a different email, it was immediately deactivated and no longer available to sell on Amazon, as the reason being I had another seller account. So I tried closing at least one of them, but they required documentation as identity proof in order to close one. I did this, but to no avail. So I requested again the support team to close at least one of them so I could open the other. Again, they said I would have to provide proof of documentation (internet bill, electric bill, credit card bill, etc) in order to open one of them back up. I have provided all of these including front and back of my drivers license, literally 8 or 9 times, but every time they open the account up for about 30 mins then deactivate it with the same reason and theyre being extremely stubborn and unfair to work with.
Bottom line is, support keeps requesting documentation, I send said documentation, then support denies to reopen my account and still asking for documentation. All I want to do is sell on Amazon with one account but Amazon wont close either one, just to keep me from selling on Amazon. Ive asked them to call me, Ive asked them to close at least one of the accounts so I dont have two at the same time so I can use one of them to sell out of, but they refuse to do it.",Account Health

Submission 2
March 22, 2020 6:09 PM EDT
Additional information
Revised Plan Of Action With Additional Details Requested Added.
The root cause of the issue
 I did not familiarize myself with the Fair Pricing Policy.
 I violated Amazon Marketplace fair pricing policy and was price gouging ASIN xxx Pack of 3 Packages, by setting a price on a product or service that is significantly higher than recent prices offered on or off Amazon.
 ASIN xxx was already in Amazons catalog and I added my inventory to this listing 03/04/2020 and instead of taking the time to thoroughly look up correct and fair pricing across multiple platforms, I set my pricing at the lowest available offer on Amazon at the time which was $24.99 what other Amazon FBM sellers were listing this for at the time I added in my offer. When I went to add the new stock to the listing I noticed the new lowest pricing was $29.xx so I changed my pricing to be competitive which I now see was violating Amazons fair pricing policy and could harm the customers trust especially during a global health crisis.
Actions I have taken to resolve the issue
 I have since deleted ASIN xxx(original policy violation), xxx (again a cleaner has been at same price point for a year or more was showing newly gated) and also XXX (another newly gated item but older listing) among others from my inventory as the category is now restricted on Amazon.
 Read Amazons fair pricing policy, more specifically setting a price on a product or service that is significantly higher than recent prices offered on or off Amazon located at https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G5TUVJKZHUVMN77V 2 and made sure to thoroughly look at my Pricing Health Dashboard located at https://sellercentral.amazon.com/pricing/health/ref=xx_xx_dnav_xx to assure I am no longer in violation for all of my current inventory.
 Went through all ASINs 1 by 1 in my inventory and deleted any items that were in violation of Amazons fair pricing policy or in the newly restricted category also:
 For all ASINs currently listed I researched competitive pricing across multiple online platforms such as Staples, Walmart, Target, Home Depot websites as well as past buy box pricing (prior to the global health crisis pricing) on Amazon to assure my pricing is in line with other offers on the marketplaces and comply with Amazon Marketplace fair pricing policy regarding not pricing higher than recent pricing on or off Amazon. I will then use the information collected to calculate my listing price by adding my cost of goods, shipping to customer or to Amazon FBA and Amazon fees.
The steps I have taken to prevent the issue going forward
 I will take the time when creating each new listing or adding my inventory to an existing listing by using the formula above (my cost+cost of shipping direct to customer or to FBA+Amazon Fees) in addition to researching selling prices across multiple selling websites or in store pricing such as Staples, Walmart , Target, past and present Amazon buy box or others as applicable to comply with Amazon Marketplace fair pricing policy.
 Weekly sale price checks on my inventory to stay in line with fair pricing as well as daily checks on my pricing health dashboard. As to follow the policy of not setting my price on a product higher than recent prices offered on or off Amazon.
I accept full responsibility for the price gouging offense and completely understand the error I have made.
I thank you for taking the time reading my plan of action. With this plan of action in place please consider reinstating my account.
Sincerely,
Still a no go and today I got this from Amazon

1608,False Copyright Infringement Claims Against Us,"There is a seller (seller CHEMION marketing@chemi-on.com) who has been submitting false copyright infringement claims against our listings.

We sell completely different products and do not use their images or text copy. Each time they submit a claim, we get our listings reactivated when we email [notice-dispute@amazon.com but during that time we lose sales. We are also worried that our account will be suspended for this company continually being able to have these false claims go through over and over again.
Our question is - Is there a way to block this company from continually being able to submit false copyright claims against us and wasting both our time and Amazons time? Is there a way to report them for this blackhat tactic? This has to be against some type of Amazon selling policy.",Account Health
1609,False Patent Infringement Claim | Letter to Seller Performance,"Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team:
I am writing on behalf of myself and many other innocent sellers who have become a victim of baseless, malicious and false Patent Infringement Claims. The current patent infringement claim system is broken!
In the American Judicial System, any crime / infringement has to be proven thoroughly before the final judgement / decision. In rare situations, some use guilty UNTIL proven innocent approach. However, Amazon is currently using the guilty DESPITE proven innocent principle. How is that fair?
I received a design patent infringement claim in 2018 at the end of last October. The claimed product had nothing in common with mine when it comes to color and design. It was filed intentionally to bring my listing down so the rights owners listing could gain more traction and sales. I was able to successfully dispute that claim and got my listing back. I thought Amazon could at least send them a policy warning and take steps to penalize such a bad actor on this platform, but I was wrong.
On Black Friday this year, the same rights owner used his attorney to file a Utility Patent Infringement Claim against my and at least 10 other sellers listings. Their Claim is false because their utility patent was granted to protect a process (not a device ), whereas my product/device itself doesnt practice or promote those claimed processes. In fact I have been instructing my buyers to practice the opposite of their claimed process on my product package and listing copy. After countless appeals to the seller performances team & many phone calls to seller support, I only got a robotic response back. It was a very heart-draining and soul-crushing experience. These are the moments that makes me question if real justice and compassion still exist if a victim has to suffer through hardships while the real villain gets away with it each time.
I figured if Amazon doesnt take my words seriously, they should take a legal professionals words into consideration. I decided to spend thousands of dollars and hired a Patent Lawyer with decades of experience. He has reviewed the claimed Patent in detail and concluded that each claim of the rights owners patent is a method/process step. Our products do not practice the method of the patent. If anything, the buyers are the direct infringers not me or my product. The allegation of infringement is without merit and is bordering on fraudulent.
I had my attorney draft a detailed patent analysis & comparison to both the rights owners attorney and Amazon. However, the seller performance team is still sending back similar but just shorter template responses If Amazon could at least review the validity of the infringement claims before closing down all the listings, it would have been more fair. If one of the employees in the team could just spend 5-10 minutes reviewing my document and proofs in detail, it could save both Amazon and sellers like me so much time, money and hassle. I have opened more than 20 cases so far with no fair resolution (other than doing nothing). The current ping-pong ball approach is definitely not efficient or fair to say the least.
I understand Amazon doesnt want the liability of taking sides when it comes to patent infringement claims. However, by doing nothing to protect my brand owner & selling rights when the claim is clearly without merit, demonstrated by my detailed evidence, Amazon is taking sides with the rights owner without them having to prove the validity of their claims. Hence, Amazon has technically incurred liability by taking sides in their refusal to act in the face of clear & convincing evidence.
One of my three blocked ASIN generated $12,916.80 in sales and sold 936 units in a comparable one-month period last year. This year, I have three ASINs for the same product, and triple amount of the 5-star reviews! It was on track to generate at least double the amount of the sales. This malicious claim has caused me more damage than I could ever have imagined, exacerbated by delays.
My attorney has tried to contact the rights owner with the detailed evidence refuting their claim, but they are lacking a timely response NOR do they have any incentive to do so. If their whole intention was to eliminate competition during the busiest sale time of the year ( they could have filed a claim any time in 2019 but instead they filed it on Black Friday ), they have succeeded and could now wait until after holidays to respond if Amazon doesnt take appropriate steps to evaluate this claim and the evidence provided.
In the meantime, innocent sellers like myself are losing sales, incurring storage fees, losing listing rankings ( on Black Friday, my listing was ranked on page 1 organically for the main short-tail keyword with hundreds of thousands of impressions ), losing scheduled deal placements, losing brand reputation, and incurring attorney fees while spending time and effort trying to resolve this issue. Amazon is losing referral & FBA fees and advertising revenues from me too. The only winner here is the rights owner, due to their bad acts.
Inspired by MLK with due respect
I have a dream that one day, Amazon would respect and help out small sellers like me and show a little more compassion and empathy.
I have a dream that one day unethical sellers would think twice before trying to sabotage their competition because they fear the consequences of their action.
I have a dream that one day sellers could communicate with real and genuine humans instead of sending words with sincerity & wisdom to a bot or an employee who is not trained to understand the totality of the circumstances.
I have a dream that one day sellers would be able to spend more time researching and improving their products and contribute to the platform instead of losing sleep and money over some malicious attack or baseless policy warnings.
I have a dream that one day Amazon will become a real virtual paradise instead of a virtual jungle that is full of hidden danger and traps.
I have a dream that one day sellers and Amazon could work together toward a common goal of providing the best value to the customers to achieve prosperous growth instead of working against each other in senseless fights and appeals.

A Desperate Seller

1611,Listing Deactivated Due to Buyer Authenticity Complaint,"Hi all,
This is my first post in the forums, but Ive been digesting lots of great information over the past few weeks that Ive found here.
So I do want to preface this with the statement that I have read through as many similar posts that relate to my situation as I can, to include the great post found here:
https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/how-to-write-a-plan-of-action-when-youve-been-suspended/217077
and here:
https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/suspended-for-selling-inauthentic-item-please-help-with-action-plan/359252/5
and their associated links.
So Ive been selling Amazon FBA for just over 5 years now. Ive sold a variety of products, but I mainly sell replacement home appliance parts. Over these 5 years, Ive almost exclusively sourced my inventory from one, reputable wholesaler. In this time, Ive sold somewhere around 30,000 units of varying name-brand, OEM parts, with great success and minimal hiccups. Ive also utilized my invoices from this wholesaler to gain access to gated subcategories and individual products themselves. Point there being Amazon has (in those instances) found my invoices to be legitimate and approved my selling certain products with this wholesaler as the source. Finally, from my own perspective, Ive had absolutely zero issues with this supplier and have received nothing but OEM products since Ive bought from them.
So early last month I started selling a product I sourced from the same supplier. A couple of weeks in I received the following seller feedback:
""I have received counterfeit product . [Manufacturer] confirmed its counterfeit .""
My first thought was that someone (a competitor?) clearly was trying to drag my (at the time) 100% feedback rating down. However, I quickly responded back to the feedback with the following statement:
""We are incredibly sorry to hear about your experience with this product! However, we can guarantee you received a 100% Authentic OEM [Manufacturer-produced product]. All of our products are sourced from verified, reputable sources, and go through a rigorous quality control check prior to being listed for sale. In light of your poor experience though, a full refund will be issued upon your request.""
So I assumed that was most likely the end of itI was wrong
Four days later I received the following Performance Notification:

Upon receiving that I dove right in to figure out how to write a Plan of Action. I went to the Help topics within Amazon, I went here, I googled. I did all of that, and that same-day I sent my invoices (from the same supplier mentioned above) and a Plan of Action that read this way:
In this Plan of Action to reinstate my listing for ASIN [XXXXXXX], I intend to fully answer the following three questions:
1. What was the root cause that led to the issue?
2. What actions will you take to resolve the issue?
3. What steps will you take to prevent future issues?
What was the root cause that led to the issue?
My listing was deactivated by Amazon as a result of customer feedback I received on 12/17/19. This feedback made the complaint that the [product] they received was counterfeit and further indicated they had verified this claim through the manufacturer, [manufacturer name]. The counterfeit claim is the root cause that has led to the deactivation of my listing.
What actions will you take to resolve the issue? The actions I have already taken are the following:
1. Upon notification that I received the negative feedback, I immediately (same-day) messaged the Buyer. I sent two separate messages. In summary, the first message addressed the following:
1. Apologized to the buyer for their negative experience
2. Assured them of the authenticity of the product they received
3. Personally (as the business owner) vouched for my product integrity and explained my companys reliance on quality and authenticity
4. Requested the buyer send me the information they received from [manufacturer]
5. Ensured the buyer a full refund would be received if requested
For the second message I utilized an Amazon template to thank them for their feedback, and provide them instructions on how to update their feedback if their problem was resolved.
2. I will continue to utilize the rigorous quality control standards Ive maintained for my business since its founding.
a. My business relies heavily on authenticity and quality, and as such, I have always maintained the strictest of quality assurance compliance protocols. My primary supplier ([supplier name]) is a company I have worked with since late 2015. [My company name] has purchased $100,000+ in inventory from them to-date. With all product that I purchase, I thoroughly review and evaluate the product to ensure it is authentic. The particular product in question (ASIN: [XXXXXXXX]) is no different, and was reviewed and determined to be an authentic, OEM [product], prior to being listed for sale.
3. I have checked my Order Defect Rate for this particular ASIN to ensure no similar complaints have been filed. This is the only complaint I have received for this ASIN. As of today, I have had approximately 468 orders and 503 units for this ASIN. This represents an Order Defect Rate of 0.0021%.
What steps will you take to prevent future issues?
In order to prevent future issues such as this, I will continue to adhere to my companys high standards of quality compliance. I will, as I have in the past, check all products I intend to list for sale for authenticity. I will never work with suppliers that I have not thoroughly vetted. I will also continue to monitor my seller account for further issues.
Ok, so I send that in. An agonizing two weeks pass and I receive another Performance Notification. This one reads this way:
Dear Seller ,
We are currently reviewing your account due to buyer complaints about the item(s) listed at the end of this email. Your listings are still active, but funds will not be transferred to you and will stay in your account while we work with you to address this issue.
Why did I receive this message?
We received buyer complaints about the authenticity of the item(s) below. In order to ensure that customers can shop with confidence on Amazon, we take inauthentic complaints seriously. The sale of counterfeit products on Amazon is strictly prohibited.
You can learn more about Amazons policies regarding the sale of counterfeit items in Seller Central Help:
Amazon Anti-Counterfeiting Policy (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/201165970 1)
Policies and Agreements (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/521 2)
What happens now?
Within the next 24 hours, you will receive a phone call from our Account Health Support team to review these complaints. If an Account Health Support associate is not able to reach you at the time of the phone call, we may temporarily deactivate your Amazon seller account.
Were here to help
If you want to discuss the status of your account immediately rather than wait for Amazon to call you, you can use this link (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/cu/contact-us/cmn/QUALITY 4) to speak directly with an Account Health Specialist. The Account Health Support team is available 7 days a week, from 6:00 a.m.-6:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.
Do you believe that you have received this message in error?
If you believe the complaints about the condition or description of your items are unjustified or received in error, please explain how you identified this issue and we will investigate your concern (for example, a complaint created by a competing Amazon seller).
You can view your accounts performance at (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/performance/dashboard?ref=ah_em_pq) or select Account Health on the home screen of the Amazon Seller app on your iOS (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amazon-Seller/id794141485) or Android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.sellermobile.android&hl=en) device.

So when I got this, I thought, wow this is great, Ill finally get to tell a live person! that someone is fraudulently making counterfeit claims against me. Well, it didnt quite workout that way. Instead of waiting for an Account Health Specialist to call me, I call them. In the conversation I lay out what Ive laid out for you all above. I tell them about my suspicions concerning the legitimacy of the feedback, but also agree that I have no way to verify who the Buyer was, or why they would have left the feedback if it wasnt true.
What happens then is a long conversation with the Specialist to re-work my POA. So I must admit, the angle that the Specialist had me take did not make much sense to me. They wanted me to re-work the POA to read more along the lines of This buyer had an inauthentic experience with my product, and heres how I intend to prevent inauthentic experiences in the future. As opposed to what I thought should be summarized, I have the proper protocols in place to ensure authenticity, always have, and have never had a complaint until now.
Either way, they work for Amazon, so what they think will help me get Seller Performance to re-instate my listing, then Ill go with it. So I re-work the POA, send it to the Specialist for review, they approve, and send to Seller Performance. Heres how the new POA read:
In this Plan of Action to reinstate our listing for ASIN [XXXXXXX] we intend to fully answer the following three questions:
1. What was the root cause that led to the issue?
2. What actions will you take to resolve the issue?
3. What steps will you take to prevent future issues?
What was the root cause that led to the issue?
The root cause that led to the issue was an inauthentic experience with our product as a result of the following:
 The [product] did not properly [do what the products meant to do].
 The [product] caused [the opposite affect of what it was meant to do].
 The [product] packaging was not as expected.
 The [product did not benefit the customer].
 The [product] did not provide [its intended use] as advertised on the listing.
What actions will you take to resolve the issue?
The actions we have already taken are the following:
 We have apologized to the buyer for their inauthentic experience, requested the product be returned to us, and issued a full refund.
 We have held several internal company meetings to determine what led to the inauthentic customer experience.
 We have contacted the products manufacturer, [manufacturer], to have our product thoroughly evaluated for authenticity.
 We have contacted our supplier and requested a full audit be conducted on the product to ensure authenticity. Weve requested a Results Report of the audit be sent to us.
 We have initiated an internal audit on all inventory on-hand to ensure 100% authenticity compliance.
 We have hired a Quality Assurance Coordinator to review the inauthentic experience and recommend courses of action.
 We have hired an additional Customer Experience Coordinator to focus solely on customer experience feedback for ASIN [XXXXXXX].
What steps will you take to prevent future issues?
 We have tasked our Quality Assurance Coordinator to develop and implement additional authenticity protocols to prevent further inauthentic experiences.
 All future inventory purchases will be audited at an individual-unit level to ensure authenticity compliance.
 We have implemented a weekly staff meeting titled Preventing Inauthentic Experiences.
 We have tasked our Customer Experience Coordinator to review all submitted customer feedback on a daily basis and produce a week-end report of the results.
 We have scheduled weekly authenticity review teleconferences with our supplier and manufacturer to ensure all proper protocols are being maintained.
So that was sent two days ago and this morning I receive the following Performance Notification:
""Dear Seller,
We received your submission but do not have enough information to reactivate your account at this time.

1618,Help With POA,"This is an updated post from a post I made yesterday regarding help I need with a POA. My original post got moved to the Product Condition forum, but no one appears to be viewing/monitoring that forum at this point, and I must submit this POA in less than 24 hours. Any help is appreciated, I have copied and pasted my proposed POA below. Thanks in advance.
To Whom it May Concern:
Enclosed is my Plan of Action for moving forward on Amazon, in response to the message I received from Amazon 4/28/20, entitled Urgent: Your Account is At Risk for Deactivation. As requested by Amazon, I have outlined a multi-step process to improve the quality of our products, service, and descriptions to comply with Amazons guidelines. This process will identify the root causes that led to the complaints about the condition of our books, the actions we have taken to resolve those complaints, and the steps we have taken to prevent future complaints about the condition of our items.
***The root causes that appeared to lead to the complaints about the conditions of a minute percentage of our items sold on Amazon are as follows:
Apparently there may have been insufficient exhaustive scrutiny of the inner condition of a few of our books. Tiny blemishes such as a small word written inside of a cover, or a price notation inside the cover apparently were not noticed at the time a book was listed for sale. The outside of the book appeared to be mint, unread, and brand new, but a tiny mark inside the book was not noticed.
It is possible that our packaging materials may have not been quite sufficient to deliver every book in the condition stated, in terms of outer appearance. We have always used high quality bubble-padded shipping mailers to ship each book. But that might not have been sufficient packing to ensure safe delivery utilizing the Post Offices shipping system. I increasingly understand that packages experience a substantial amount of wear during the shipping process, and a stiff padded envelope may not be sufficient to adequately survive the shipping process.
***We have taken the following action to resolve those complaints:
We have provided refunds to customers who have contacted us regarding complaints. Those refunds have come in the form of full refunds when the book has been returned to us.
We have also issued partial refunds as occasion has allowed, to those who wished to keep the book in the condition in which it arrived.
We have worked diligently to communicate with buyers and provide amicable resolutions to any issues that have arisen.
***We have taken the following steps to prevent future complaints about the condition of our items:
We will diligently escalate our scrutiny of each and every item that we sell. Our process has always included a vigorous examination of both the outer condition and inner condition of every single book. This has also included a secondary and tertiary examination of every book prior to being shipped, to ensure that the book is in the same condition prior to being shipped, as it was when it was listed for sale. Moving forward, however, this process will include not only an examination by one of our personnel, but it will also include a second examination by me personally prior to shipping. We will have categorical examination of each book that is shipped, with a checklist of questions asked of each book, such as does the book have even the slightest creasing to the spine? Does it have any blemishes whatsoever on either the front or back cover? Does it have any pen marks or even the tiniest crease, ding, or mark on the cover? If any of those apply, the book is not and will not be classified as New or Like New.
We will take extra care to provide adequate packaging and protection in order to ensure that our books arrive to the customer in the condition stated. Extra padding, additional layers of packaging protection, and boxes will all be a part of ensuring that our products arrive in the condition stated and expected.
We will add additional details to our descriptions of each book whenever possible. We will go into extensive detail regarding any and all flaws that a book may possess so that customers will fully understand exactly what condition in which they will be receiving their book. Any book that has any flaws of any kind will certainly not be listed in the New or Like New category.
We will work even more diligently to quickly and effectively communicate with our buyers to discuss any issues that may arise, so that they understand every step of the process and know what to expect during each step.
***We take fierce pride in customer satisfaction and providing our customers with high quality products with every single order, as shown by our Order Defect Rate (ODR) of 0% in the past 60 days. Also in the past 60 Days, our Late Shipment rate is 0%. Our Pre-Fulfillment Cancel Rate is 0%. Our A to Z Claim Rate is 0%. Our Chargeback Claims are 0%. Our Valid Tracking Rate is 100%. Our Feedback Rating is 100% over the past 60 Days. Over that same 60 Day span, we have shipped 1,569 units, according to our Sales Dashboard metrics on Amazon.com. Over the past 6 months, we have shipped over 3,500 units.
We have been a Professional seller on Amazon for the past 17 years. Since 2003, we have been providing professional, timely, top-notch service and high quality books for customers all over the world. We look forward to continuing to serve our Amazon customers with even further enhanced customer service and even higher quality items in the future. Thank you

1619,My brother and I cant sell our own patented invention,"Hi Sellers,
Running into issues with a used sold as new complaint on an invention my brother and I have.
After 1-Year of issue-free selling of our invention on Amazon.com. We have recently had two of our ASINs removed. Each ASIN is a member of the same parent. One is an FBA single quantity item, the other is a MFN 2-Pack.
We have no returns on this ASIN recently besides No longer needed. No return has comments mentioning damage, used, or anything along those lines.
Our Account Health is perfect. 0% order defect. 0 product policy complaints (besides these two). 100% on-time shipment. Excellent CX Health on this listing. 0 negative feedback. 0 a-to-z claims. 0 chargebacks. We accept returns without question. We go above and beyond to distance ourselves from Amazons customers and not link to ourselves as the inventors.
Im looking for some advice on where to go from here. Ive tried to reach through to Seller Performance, but I was rejected for insufficient information. Please read my plan of action below and feel free to comment on where we have gone wrong.
Also, as the person fulfilling these orders. I know what is leaving our facility. Am I wrong for believing that this could be another seller or buyer with malicious intent?
Please note: we also attached invoices from our manufacturer to the appeal. Granted, they are older than 365 days because we had to place a large initial production order to get our costs down.

Please view the following as a detailed response to the suspension of Blazer Brands selling privileges for ASIN: B0824Q7QBK as of April 26, 2020. Contained within are responses to performance complaints, an examination of Blazer Brands practices, outlines of future standards, and the promotion of a cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship between Blazer Brand LLC and Amazon moving forward.
ASIN Context
Blazer Brand is the brand name, IP holder, barcode owner, and party responsible for manufacturing and distribution of ASIN: B0824Q7QBK. This ASIN is an inner pack containing two of GTIN: 00866404000226. The two units of this GTIN are inspected and then shipped together as a two-pack.
Customer Complaint
According to our performance notification, a customer marked ASIN: B0824Q7QBK (sold by Blazer Brand) as a used item being sold as new.
Blazer Brand understands the seriousness of this issue in order to protect Amazons customers from ill-intended sellers and unacceptable quality of goods upon arrival.
Blazer Brand has limited contextual information regarding this complaint, but we have sought to sincerely identify all potential root causes. We have selected three internally controllable sources of this complaint.
Identified Root Causes
Damaged Retail Pack : The ASINs inner pack retail packs are made from coated chipboard with a custom printed design from Blazer Brand. Unacceptable damage to the packaging upon arrival at the buyers address may have led to this complaint being filed. The boxes hanging tab is the primary concern. Damage was either present upon shipping or occurred during the shipment from Blazer Brand LLC to the Amazon Buyer.
Peeled Warranty Sticker for New Products : As of April 16, 2020, Blazer Brand began adding stickers highlighting the product was new from our manufacturing facilities and came with a 1-Year Warranty backed by Blazer Brand. This change was implemented due to a previous Plan of Action issued in response to a similar issue on another child member of this ASINs Parent. The 1-Year Warranty is also in the listing so buyers are aware prior to purchase. For labels, we used Avery 5160 Laser printing mailing labels. It is possible the adhesive wasnt permanent enough to maintain adhesive integrity throughout shipping. As a result, it may have appeared to be open upon arrival.
Actual Used Item : Blazer Brand must identify this potential cause for the sake of critical analysis. This scenario is highly unlikely due to Blazer Brands use of new palletized inventory for fulfilling all orders. For the purpose of improvement, we must include this potential root cause which would be a direct failure of our fulfillment systems.
How to Resolve this Issue
Blazer Brand desires access to more context regarding this issue in order to be able to resolve it in the most efficient manner. We have not received any communications from a customer on this issue since December of 2019 when we quickly resolved the customer inquiry. Regardless, we have taken the following steps to analyze our systems in relation to the root causes above.
Blazer Brand has ensured all goods are being pulled from new inventory and inspected prior to shipment by the person fulfilling orders. We currently hold only one palletized good, which is the GTIN used in this ASIN.
We have checked to make sure all return are stored within a separate location in our facility. At this time, all returns are unpackaged not to be sold again.
We have re-examined our analysis of new inventory and damaged-new inventory.
New goods meet all of the requirements of Amazons Seller Condition Guidelines https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200339950
Damaged-new would be goods that are not acceptable for shipment to customers due to retail package damage. These goods are set aside and sold on alternate sales channels (such as eBay) or they are unpackaged and marked as new for package-less wholesale to Blazer Brands independent customers separate from Amazon.com
Furthermore, Blazer Brand has reinforced and detailed its existing classification system and posted it on the wall in our order fulfillment room. Please see the next section for details.
In order to check on peeling stickers. Blazer Brand has inspected new goods that had been labeled on April 15, 2020. There are zero instances of peeled labels. Regardless, Blazer Brand has ordered upgraded thermal labels (Dymo Return Address Labels  x 2) to ensure a high-quality sticker represents a new package with Blazer Brands 1-Year Manufacturers Warranty.
We have analyzed our criteria for a new item.
Must have a rubber strap coiled and wrapped in packaging tape.
Must have an instruction set.
Must have a New 1-Year Warranty Sticker as of April 16, 2020.
All plastic parts must be free from scuffs and scratches
Plastic parts will arrive screwed together with a cardboard spacer in between the pieces.
Outer retail packs must be free from all cosmetic damage when viewed from 12 inches away.
In contrast, a used item would have the following qualities
Presence of dirt or grim due to the fact these are used on garbage cans.
Scratches or scuffs are common after a good has been used.
Missing cardboard spacer from plastic components.
Damaged or ripped retail packaging.
What would we do if a customer contacted us?
In December of 2019, a customer contacted Blazer Brand stating his packaging was damaged upon arrival and it didnt appear to be from shipping. This customer asked for new packaging since he wanted to give the item as a gift. Blazer Brand promptly responded to the request and shipped the customer brand new packaging without hesitation. The customer ended up leaving Blazer Brand 5-star seller feedback.
If a customer contacted us with a used item complaint, Blazer Brand would promptly send a replacement for the item. If a replacement is insufficient, we would offer the buyer a full refund on their order. We have made excellent customer service a habit.
Plans to Prevent Issues Moving Forward
Blazer Brand holds itself to a high-standard and we have evaluated our processes and we have already begun/will continue to implement the following.
Primary Fulfillment Inspection Method
New inventory arrives at Blazer Brand from our contract manufacturer, [MANUFACTURER]. Upon arrival, pallets of goods are stored. When inventory is needed for fulfillment, boxes are unloaded from a pallet and placed on a shelf in our fulfillment room. Initially, a check is performed to make sure these boxes (which contain ten units) are in proper condition and were not damaged during shipment to Blazer Brand.
Prior to fulfillment, Inventory is moved from the shelves to our prep area where individual boxes will be inspected prior to shipment. We have posted images on the walls in accordance with Amazons Condition Guidelines.

Once items are determined to be in a new condition. We add a sticker with links to a digital instruction guide. We also add a New 1-Year Warranty sticker to seal the box. The sticker will be a thermal printed Dymo return address label (3/4 x 2). Our labels are set to arrive on April 28, 2020. After labeling, the two GTINs of the inner pack for this ASIN are placed into a 12x6x4 32lb test shipping box purchased from ULINE. The boxes tabs are face inward and nested together to prevent damage.
Subsidiary Methods to Maintain Product Quality
Referencing a previous Plan of Action. Blazer Brand began labeling retail packs with a sticker indicating the item was new and backed by a 1-Year Warranty from Blazer Brand. We hoped this would encourage sellers to contact us if they had any questions or complaints. We have upgraded the permanence of this sticker to guarantee a pack cannot be opened after it has been sealed.
Blazer Brand is a young business, we have previously proposed our future intent to upgrade the packaging for this ASIN to better handle shipment. Currently, we are selling units from our first ever production order of this ASIN. We do not have the capital to repackage goods, but we are making plans for better packaging in the future. Granted, this is assuming damaged packaging during shipment was the root cause of the complaint. Blazer Brand is currently exploring ideas such as Frustration Free Packaging.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Please see attached invoices for proof that Blazer Brand is purchasing inventory.
Please note: the purchase date is older than 365 days. Blazer Brand ordered 10,000 units of our novel good in 2018. We are just now starting to see an uptick in sales after one-year on the market.
SOURCING
Our contracted supplier is one of the top injection-molders in the United States. They ensure quality throughout the manufacturing process. We are responsible for defining what a new item is and distributing new Strong Straps. Strong Straps cannot be sold without Blazer Brands involvement.
LISTING
The listing is accurately described. Our listing highlights any limitations of our solution. Our listing includes our warranty. If edits need to be made to the listing, we will need to be granted access to make those changes.
PACKAGING
The packaging is in its original state. We are the party responsible for determining this original state and we are the party that handles all manufacturers warranty claims. All packages must pass the aforementioned inspection process before leaving Blazer Brand.
SHIPPING
We package only approved new condition items for shipment to Amazon customers. Individual shipments are shipped in 32lb ECT corrugated boxes from ULINE.
REVIEW COMMUNICATIONS FROM BUYER
We have no communications beyond used item sold as new.
INVOICE and PROOF OF CONDITION
Please see the attached invoice. Note: the date is beyond 365 days. As the inventors of the product we have been working hard to establish this novel solution. We were beginning to see an uptick in sales this Spring. We still have a long way to go to continue to distribute our solution.

Blazer Brands Potential Concern
Blazer Brand has prioritized the information listed above. Yet, we are concerned with the sudden issuance of two back-to-back complaints that have resulted in the removal of our invention (1 of 4 SKUs our company holds).
Blazer Brand is concerned malicious practices may be the source of these complaints if they continue to come in within a short period of time. Our two-person business has been on high-alert as to the quality of packages leaving our facility. All packages are delivered with either UPS of USPS. We distribute a new, patented good that has jumped up the leaderboard for its category. The Parent ASIN is #8 on the Best Sellers List for outdoor garbage bins. Our seller account shows near perfect performance and our systems have not failed for almost a year of selling on Amazon.com. Yet, within the past two weeks we have seen two of the same complaints. If Amazon can help provide additional information regarding the complaint, it will ease our concerns and help us meet the high standard we have set for ourselves.",Account Health
1620,Product Restricted due to COVID19 - Seller Support Telling Me to do 2 different things,"Based on the information provided below the line of dashes, we sell a Japanese laundry detergent we buy from distributors, and sell as well. We do not believe that selling this product is a violation of Amazons policy, as a result Ive attempted to contact Amazon to find how I can contact Amazon to reinstate the listings.
Call #1 Seller Support told us to gather safety certification documents, but failed to mention which certifications to send an Amazon email. Checked the Amazon email and I cant send to that email.
Call #2 Seller Support told us to relist the product despite the restriction is this a good idea? couldnt we get suspended for this?
Reaching out to @Edward_Amazon, if I call go to Get Help and I go to the contact us, what section do i go to and press to speak to someone who can tell me what do correctly do to comply with Amazons policies.
In order to help our customers better find the products they need during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have increased our controls on new product listings for certain Personal Safety and Household products, such as gloves, soap, paper products, thermometers, and related products. With this in mind, we have sidelined the products listed above for review. Please see https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/GU5H4KPBMUFE6XHH 9 for additional information.
Why is this happening?
We took this action because this product is not permitted for sale on Amazon.com. It is your obligation to make sure the products you offer comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and Amazons policies.
What actions do I need to take?
If any of the above ASINs are Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) offers, please initiate a removal request for the ASIN(s) referenced above to have your inventory sent to a location of your choosing. If you fail to initiate a removal request within 30 days of this notification, we may dispose of it in accordance with the Amazon Services Business Solutions Agreement and FBA policies. For more information on our FBA policies, please review https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/201030350 1 and https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/200140860.
Within 48 hours of this warning, please review your listings and close, delete, or archive any listings that do not comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and Amazons policies, including the product(s) listed above.
Please note that moving a restricted product listing to Inactive (Out of Stock) does not make the listing compliant. If you think your product was incorrectly identified as a restricted product on Amazon, close the listing immediately to ensure compliance while you appeal the restriction with Seller Support.
What happens if I fail to follow the above instructions?
Failure to properly close or delete all restricted product listings from your inventory may result in the deactivation of your selling account, and funds may be permanently held.",Account Health
1621,Funds held indefinitely?,"I was suspended for a pack of paper towels (priced accordingly to amazons $17 fee). It took 3 weeks for appeal and apparently I need more info. I dont have more info, thats literally it. My first violation and it was for price gouging. I put in an order to pull my inventory and just going to keep selling on eBay since that is going week for me - question : it says that my money will be held 90 days to indefinitely - does that mean they are just going to keep my payouts? If I request to close my account do I lose that money?",Account Health
1622,"The new seller (asin) is wrong. But my product is also true, in line with industry standards. Cant Amazon give me a chance?","And it didnt sell successfully. After receiving the warning, I immediately deleted asin. Why should I stop my account? I have submitted the information twice. I hope it works!",Account Health
1623,Another Seller Account Deactivated for Unauthentic Items,"Hello,
I got the dreaded Account Deactivated for possible Unauthentic Items email a couple of weeks ago. I source all my store items via local retail arbitrage opportunities. My inventory was posted on existing Amazon listings and I was doing FBM. A quick Google search makes RA seem like dirty words these days, but I would still like my funds released, even if my store is permanently shut down. Any advice on getting my appeal approved so I can move on with my life? I obviously do not have anything besides store receipts. I have admitted this much already with them, but i get the same canned message stating below basically. Finally, my seller account has zero negative feedback or any other violation, but granted my store was only 2 weeks old before getting shut down. thank you all for your time.

Dear PLOOP,
We removed some of your listings because of customer complaints about items listed at the end of this email. Customers may be complaining because the items they received did not accurately match the condition or description of the product mentioned in the product detail page of your listings.
Why did I receive this message?
Amazon has several product detail and listing policies to ensure customers have a consistent buying experience and receive items in the condition they expect. Products listed in new condition are expected to arrive in brand new, unopened condition with no signs of damage or wear.

Complaint Type ASIN Title Additional Information
Used Item Sold as New B07C1K13LC adidas Originals Mens NMD_R1 STLT PK Running Shoe, White/Grey one/Soft Pink, 9 M US
Responded with the following POA which was declined as per Selling applications page:
1. What caused customers to complain about the condition of your items?
 ASIN B07C1K13LC showed signs of use (dirty and worn appearance) causing a negative customer experience because customer purchased, and was expecting, the item in a brand new and unworn condition. The reason ASIN B07C1K13LC showed signs of use was because it was purchased and used by another buyer who then returned the item to me for a refund. Then this returned item was re-entered into inventory for sale again without adequate inspection. This buyer then purchased this previously returned item.
2. What have you done to resolve the issue(s) that caused the customer complaints about the condition of your items?
 I have communicated professionally and promptly with customers to address all order issues.
 I have carefully examined all products in my inventory and thoroughly inspected for any signs of damage or use. I have disposed of any units that Ire not in Brand New condition and deleted the respective listings from my Manage Inventory page.
 I have confirmed with my suppliers that all the products that I am receiving are brand new and in undamaged condition. Products in any other condition will not be accepted and will be returned.
 I reviewed Amazons Condition Guidelines (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/200339950) and determined that some of our products are not assigned the correct condition because they have been previously returned from another buyer and contain signs of wear including, but not limited to, debris on the outsole, scuffs, scrapes, and being dirty. These items are wrongfully represented as BRAND NEW when it is more accurately in Used condition. For all other listings, I have confirmed that the listing information is accurate and matches the product being sold.
 I reviewed Amazon Product Authenticity and Quality Help Page (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G202010130 2). I ensured all products Ire purchased directly from the manufacturer and that a quality check was conducted for each inventory item.
 I reviewed Amazons Product Detail Page Rules (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/200390640)
 I reviewed Amazons Best Practices in Product Authenticity and Quality (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/learn/courses?ref_=su_courses_c12_m554&courseId=12&moduleId=554) and have scored 100% on the product quality - appeal quiz.
 I have reviewed Prohibited Seller Activities and Actions (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/200386250)
3. What actions will you be taking to prevent future complaints about the condition of your items?
 I have inspected all Amazon returns for wear and usage. I will not relist items on Amazon once it is returned. Instead, I will discard returned items.
 I have gone through all of my warehouse inventory and have taken out any items that show any signs of damage or defectiveness. This has ensured all products are new as described on the detail page.
 I have implemented a three person review of the appropriate item being packaged for delivery in Excel type checklists that the fulfillment team can log, record, and track. If the product does not match the product detail page 100% or stated Brand New condition, I delete the product from our account.
 I have implemented a three-person quality review of each product to ensure the product is free form defect or damage.
 I have implemented a three-person review of each product to ensure the product is in its original packaging and in brand new condition as listed.
 I have trained each employee to check each product against its product label to ensure each item is packaged correctly and cleanly.
 I have trained each employee to check each product against the amazon order to ensure the customer is receiving exactly what they ordered in the exact condition brand new condition they ordered.
 I have reviewed customer and product feedback, and the voice of the customer amazon page to identify trouble ASINs and remove such ASINs from my product catalog going forward.
 I have expanded storage space to ensure each product is stored safely and cleanly.
 I have removed all listings that are not within Amazon.com policy. I will not relist until a full analysis of all ASINs. Only when the product matches the ASIN 100% will I then list the product for sale.
 I have reviewed all listings for accuracy. If a listing is inaccurate, I either correct the information or unlist the products offered under the listing.
 I have re-written the description and bullet points to improve accuracy of the items presentation to Amazon.com standards.
 I have re-photographed all items that are not displaying the product accurate enough.",Account Health

1630,Restricted product bot gone wild,"We just had 30 ASINs removed from the catalog, most of which are sitting on the shelves at FBA. The rationale is: In order to help our customers better find the products they need during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have increased our controls on new product listings for certain Personal Safety and Household products, such as disposable face masks, hand sanitizers, disinfecting wipes and sprays, isopropyl alcohol, and related products. They also claim that "" We took this action because this product is not permitted for sale on Amazon.com. It is your obligation to make sure the products you offer comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and Amazons policies."" HUH?? These are not new products, and why are they suddenly not permitted for sale?
These are dangerous things like:
white board markers, cleaners, and erasers
bathroom cleaners and mold removal spray
pool deck resurfacing coating
There was one ASIN for masks that we havent sold in years. So the false positive rate was 97%.
AND WHAT ARE THEY DEMANDING WE DO? We have to remove the products from FBA within 30 days or they will dispose of them and close the listings within 48 hours. AND IF WE DONT: What happens if I fail to follow the above instructions?
Failure to properly close or delete all restricted product listings from your inventory may result in the deactivation of your selling account, and funds may be permanently held. THATS RIGHT, IF WE DONT THEY MAY DEACTIVATE OUR ACCOUNT AND KEEP OUR MONEY.

February 17, 2020
Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team,
Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to appeal my seller accounts suspension for listing restricted products that are prohibited from sale on Amazon.
What went wrong:
Unfortunately, I believe all of this started as a result of a misunderstanding. My account was incorrectly suspended for listing prohibited products. The ASIN in question:
ASIN: B005L38VT8, SKU: 3R-VBHM-7893, Title: ""Targus Stylus for iPad, iPhone, iPod, Samsung Tablets, Smartphones and Other Touchscreen Devices, Cream (AMM0113US)
The product I was trying to list was a simple stylus used for handheld products. In retrospect, I I dont know what gave the impression that this item was a red laser pointer? This is where the problem occurred, and as you can hopefully see it was truly a misunderstanding.
What I have done to fix the issue.
Although, this situation appears to be an honest misunderstanding,
I have carefully reviewed all of Amazons guidelines. Furthermore, to prevent any such violations from occurring in the future, Ive researched information regarding the sale of restricted products, the correct way to aadvertise my products.
Ive educated myself about the products that are prohibited from sale and cant be listed. This includes your Restricted Products policy, including the Examples of Prohibited Listings section. Though its important to point out Ive never missed it a prohibited item, I have educated myself on what those items are to prevent any problems in the future.
The final step Ive taken is to remove all of the listings that were in doubt, and being questioned. In the future, I will double check all of my listings to make sure that the products are described accurately, and are fully compliant with the rules that Amazon has set forth.
What I will do to prevent this from happening again:
Though, my account was suspended for restricted products, Im truly innocent of this charge. It was never my intention to list, or sell a red laser pointer, I was only trying to advertise a simple stylus for handheld devices. By no means am I minimizing what took place, its just important to note I did not list any restricted products.
Before listing any new items on Amazon, I will verify that they are permitted for sale and compliant with Amazon policies and procedures.
To help me ensure that I do not violate any more policies, I will also research whether all of my products are accurately described, and correctly listed in the most informative way for any potential buyers.
I will routinely review Amazons policies to stay aware of any updates, and to monitor changes in regulations. Ensuring I can immediately take action, and proactively remain compliant with my listings. Any products that I am unable to verify with 100% certainty, will not be listed.
In conclusion , I believe that this plan provides that this issue has been rectified, and Ill prevent it from occurring again. I look forward to having my selling privileges restored. I also look forward to hearing from you! Thanks again for your time
Again thanks for any assistance or help you provide it is greatly appreciated.",Account Health
1636,What do you think my appel for 3 asin inauthentic product,"Hello Everyone!
Your comments and ideas are important to me.
Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team
Thank you for providing me the oppotunity to appeal my seller accounts suspension. First of all, I want to tell you that I am a new seller in Amazon.
I want to say that I could not reach the suppliers of the ASIN numbers you want for the problem and have tried this many times. I am the main source of this error and I made a solution oriented plan that I explained this.
In order to add more professional and error-free products, I used a software and added some non-approved products to my inventory as a result of my carelessness.
We understand the mistakes we make, these are our mistakes.
I would like to share with you my Plan of Action in which explain what I have done to resolve the issue and what will I do to prevent similar complaints in the future.
What happened:
We uploaded products that are not 100% compatible with the product listing page.
While listing the products, we also added some unverified products to our inventory with our other products.
While checking our products with some software more frequently and for the least error, we added some unverified products as a result of our error to our inventory.
What I have done to resolve this issue:
We have gone through our entire inventory and removed all the problematic products.
I disabled my inventory in order not to affect anything more in a short period of time.
I have carefully reviewed all Merchant by Amazons policies and help pages, especially the ones regarding Section 3 of Amazons Business Solutions Agreement
I removed the software and set up a team to keep the inventory up-to-date and control.
I made a detailed review of many policies on stocking and presenting products in Amazon product compliance section.
What I will do prevent this from happening again:
From now on, We will not publish until all ASINs are in full compliance.
We have created a checklist in Excel and we know that this checklist is necessary for us to perform product quality audits successfully.
I will contact my supplier directly before adding the products to my inventory and keep a copy of all necessary documents.
I will continue sourcing all my inventory directly from the manufactures.
I will regularly read and re-read the Amazon guidelines and policies to make sure that I am not in violation of any of the rules. Also, I will monitor all changes of the policies or any applicable laws, which could affect me or my account and react proactively.
I will review all the products one by one and add them to my inventory in the healthiest way.
I believe that this plan sufficiently addresses the issue and I hope I will be able to continue selling on Amazon.
Best Regards,",Account Health
1637,"Suspended - But first my apologies for other thread, misunderstood","First I want to apologize for my first thread, in no way did i mean any offense or was trying to argue my case. I honestly just wanted some information on counterfeit kool aid. I see now that it wasnt appropriate So my apologies.
Now my suspension, any help is greatly appreciated
I got suspended for inauthentic Kool aid Packets- Please correct me if im wrong because I need to know thisSince my suspension was for inauthentic then that means that I only need to prove that the Kool Aid is indeed authentic Kool Aid right. Is that the only concern I need to address? (i would love to get this done right the first time, fingers crossed!) Also for invoicesit is just my luck that my computer did a factory reset and I no longer have any invoices up until yesterday. I did however just place a new order with my supplier for the same Kool Aid packets and do have that most recent invoice. Also it says that the invoice must match the quantity sold on my account. there is a problem with that and the only most recent invoice I have. When I first bought and listed these Kool Aid packets I only experiment with a small amount to see how well they sell. So the invoice I have is a greater amount then what I had listed on my account. I dont know how to go about getting the first invoice which was a small experiment amount. I have tried contacting the supplier but with this whole crisis you cant get anyone, Not even Amazon and other big chains, so Im stuck with that. I hope the invoice I have will work?

CAUSA DE LA RAIZ DEL PROBLEMA:
Cuando enumere el producto lo adjunte al Asin  ya existente, ( nombre de la marca del producto ) , en el momento de hacer un anlisis al producto en la pgina de Amazon no revise la informacin lo suficientemente de cerca y no me percate que no coincida con la misma marca de la pgina del propietario del producto (marca del producto), los artculos que estaba en ese momento por comprar tenan diferente nombre en la tienda de (--------) ; (nombre del producto que se compro ) , la compra la realice el da (fecha ) con Order Number: 0000000 a las 00:00 horas.

Seller Support seems to think that the FDA Approved on the labeling, and therefore in the images, is a violation of the FDAs brand itself, somehow, and I cant get through to them that FDA approved is going to be on the labeling, etc, becausewell, it is just that.

1641,Listing Policy Violations  Violation of Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy,"Go this E-Mail from Amazon today and they blocked 3 ASINs I was selling under. It was obviously an error done by the automation bots as I have not violated the unfair pricing policy. The prices are the same as they have been for the last year or so, same as what can be found on other venues, and in one case my price was actually lower than what Amazon itself is selling the same item for. I believe I was the lowest priced seller of all three items.
I appealed all three of these violations but it has made it obvious how fragile a sellers account is when you can get violations under your performance health which are errors.
I turned my store off and looked at all of my prices like the E_Mail said to, and read the policy which I had already read recently. What I am wondering, is now will they suspend my account for having these 3 Listing Policy Violations even though it was in error by their price bots?",Account Health

1645,Amazons vicious circle!,"Guys, good day! I dont know what to do anymore! A vicious circle on Amazon and we are like a pony running through it A month ago, I received a block on 64 ASIN for copyright infringement. I was complained about by a competitor who sells similar products made on a different material and of worse quality. The competitor has rights to the combination of words Prancing Moose, I didnt know it and used it, but after his claim, I removed all these combinations of words from all my products. For two weeks, I was fighting with Amazon bots, which responded like a broken record the same thing, but sometimes, when a certain person read my letters, I received letters of apology and that I could sell my product further. My wife got the copyright for her products (design) in the UK. During these two weeks I provided a certificate of copyright and an explanation that I can not provide documents for the purchase of this product anywhere for the simple reason that I produce all the goods on my own and with my own hands! I managed to recapture most of the ASIN, with 25 remaining out of 64. Forth, I on forum sellers described situation and Melinda from Amazon me helped unlock remaining 25 ASIN. But in the process of fighting out of desperation, I deleted all the ASINS that were in the complaint. Creating a new ASIN and not using forbidden words a week later, I got blocked again from the same person for the same reasons, that is, most likely, he registered a trademark for the combination of words Prancing Moose on Amazon, but I do not use these words anymore. And by the way, the health of the account has not changed in any way and by the time you write a refutation as in the first case, my products are simply blocked.
Guys help me please, advise where to run and what to do, I am already ready to pay (within reason of course) for a competent letter for Amazon from a lawyer. It seems that the complainer has priority in any situation, not even controversial and the guys from Amazon do not even try to understand the essence of the problem and most often respond to bots and not real people. I understand that they are not lawyers, especially on intellectual property, but then you do not need to act as a judge, one will punish and the other will raise. We must then still proceed from common sense. Sorry for my English, I use Google translator. In my case, it is probably heroic that I have been trading for almost 5 years with 100% account health quality. Would any of you try to trade on Russian trading platforms.
With deep respect to the community and Amazon, Alexander!

 Greater detail on the steps you have taken to prevent the policy violation going forward;
 Greater detail on how your account has complied with our policy; and
 Greater detail on evidence or examples that demonstrate that your account has complied with our policy.
This is my POA:
What Went Wrong, Root Cause of Issue
Priced items that violated the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy.
Almost all our orders are typically FBA, mainly in the toy section. With the current global situation regarding COVID-19, had to adapt to and expand our FBM model and expand our product offerings. Some of these new offerings, mostly health items, are new to our product assortment.
Did not properly research the pricing history for the ASINs in question.
Priced the ASINs competitively to sellers already with a listing for the ASINs without doing the proper research on the pricing history. Used a similar formula for profit margin as utilized on our FBA items, which is around 30%.
The ASINs were priced using cost of goods plus shipping into one price. Did not utilize shipping templates.
What We Have Done to Fix the Problems
We have removed any listing that did not comply with the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy.
We have updated the pricing for all similar ASINs to better reflect the current market prices.
Read and reviewed Fair Pricing/ Pricing Your Item https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/62551 and Policies and Agreements (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/521)
C. What we have done to prevent the problems from happening again in the future
Implemented a daily task of checking account/pricing dashboard for any violations. If any are found, the ASIN listing would immediately be deleted while we follow up on the cause.
Research pricing on various other platforms and retailers (eBay, Walmart, Target, Walgreens) to offer the best price possible. If it is found that we are not competitively priced, adjustments will be made.
Make use of shipping templates to better reflect the fair market value selling price of the item plus the shipping cost that would include shipping costs and packing supplies.
All the above steps will help make certain that our account complies with Amazon policy.
Any advice, good or bad, is welcomed. Thanks!",Account Health
1647,Suspended for LSR,"Here is the latest appeal I submitted to Amazon that was rejected. Our funds and merchant fulfilled selling privileges have been blocked for over 2 months now. Any help would be much appreciated.
The root cause of the issue
The root cause(s) of the late shipment confirmations:
I had given the responsibility of confirming our Amazon confirmations to a warehouse staff member to relieve some of my daily duties and give them a chance at having more responsibility in our operations.
The reason why I had to decided to pass on my daily duty of confirming our shipments is because January is one of our busiest times in our industry, we are selling health supplements primarily in the diet & nutrition category and I felt like I had to focus more of my time on ordering inventory to meet customer demand.
There was a busy weekend where we had hundreds of orders to confirm ship by today. Our staff member that was responsible for confirming shipment had not realized there were multiple pages to scroll through to confirm shipments, each page only allows you to select 100 orders at a time to confirm shipment.
I had also failed to double check that all ship by todays were confirmed by our staff member, which resulted in orders having a late shipment confirmation.
The majority of our business is on our Amazon.ca marketplace compared to our Amazon.com 1. During our busy season I had been too focused on our Canadian marketplace and had neglected to check our performance notifications on our American side when our late shipments were getting too high.
The actions you have taken to resolve the issue
The actions you have taken to resolve the late shipment confirmations:
All our orders were still shipped out the same day and were delivered on time, we had just failed to confirm shipment.
I have addressed the importance of making sure all our orders are confirmed to ship to all staff members that are involved in shipping our Amazon orders.
I have also been much more diligent myself in double checking every day at 12 pm that all our ship by today orders are confirmed.
The steps you have taken to prevent the issue going forward
The steps you have taken to prevent late shipment confirmations going forward:
Going forward, we have a warehouse employee who is in charge of packing, labelling, and shipping our amazon orders check and confirm our ship by today every morning at 11 am.
I have included double checking that all our ship by today orders have been confirmed every day at 12 pm back into my daily routine as I realize now how big the consequences are (having our account suspended) for failing to do so.
I have also hired a personal assistant to help me manage both our marketplaces and check our account health daily to ensure that we meet Amazons policies.",Account Health

1649,Fair Pricing Policy Violation Plan Of Action,"Hi,
One of my asins came under the sweep of the coronavirus.
My asin was blocked and I got a call from Amazon to get me to write a POA failing which my account will be suspended.
This is my POA. I would appreciate if you guys could provide some feedback.
Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team,
Thank you for providing me an opportunity to appeal my seller accounts listing policy violation. The ASIN in question is xxxx
What went wrong:
I failed to read Amazon fair pricing policy guidelines and applicable laws regarding the pricing of items on Amazons marketplace.
I priced the item significantly lower than available on some other marketplaces but it was still higher than what was available on Amazon recently and some other marketplaces. For example: I found the same item on xxxx to be $116.00. Walmart had it available for $69.99 when I checked but the listing is now not available. I realize that this particular product did see quite a bit of price fluctuations recently and at one point my pricing was higher than what was reasonable.
My cost basis for this ASIN is $40. Invoices attached for your reference. I had priced the item based on the cost price, administrative/logistics costs involved and pricing on other marketplaces. As you can see the relative cost of purchase for this product has also seen an uptick recently.
I take full responsibility for this issue and would like to share my plan of action, which describes how I will prevent this from happening again.
What I have done to fix the issue:
I have carefully reviewed all Amazon policies, guidelines and help pages, especially the ones regarding the pricing practices sellers should follow on Amazons marketplace. I have understood all the requirements to maintain my seller account fully complaint and educated myself about the pricing practices the seller should be aware of.
With immediate effect, I have dropped the price of ASIN xxx to $54.99 which is in line with what was available on Amazon recently and other marketplaces too.
After reading about the pricing policy violation under the account health link, I went through my entire inventory to compare our prices with prices offered on other marketplaces. We have not found any violations currently, but any item found to be in violation of the Amazon policies, restrictions or applicable laws will be removed.
At this time, I have double checked all of the listings to make sure that the products are priced accurately and are fully compliant with the rules that the Amazon has set forth.
What I will do to prevent this from happening again:
Before listing any new items on Amazon, I will compare the pricing on other marketplaces to make sure that our prices on Amazon are at or under those currently offered on other marketplaces or the recent prices offered on Amazon.
I will regularly review the Amazon policies again and on a weekly basis to catch any of their updates and monitor changes in laws and regulations to ensure I can immediately take action and proactively remove any potentially non-compliant listings on time.
I will check the prices offered by us on a weekly basis to make sure they are line with recent prices on Amazon and for similar products on other marketplaces.
Any products that have not been verified will not be listed.
I believe this plan sufficiently addresses the issue and will prevent it from occurring again. I look forward to having my selling privileges restored for ASIN xxx
Thank you",Account Health

1656,Account Suspended- Related Account + Utility Bill,"Hey Guys,
Reaching out today in hope that I can get some useful guidelines/feedback on my current situation.
Basically a few months ago tried to open a NA account and link it to my already existing Seller account. Upon creation by mistaken Ive registered with my personal Amz account (different email, bank card) instead of the same one Im using for the Seller account.
Provided the necessary docs however requested to close it straight away since my intention was different. After a lot of back and forth managed to close the account so I can avoid being charged additional monthly fees. The Support team assured me that the account is inactive and will stay this way if no further action is taken.
Fast forward to few weeks ago tried to link my existing Seller account to the NA marketplace via Global selling not thinking that will be affected in some way. Surprise- Straight away been charged and the account suspended in accordance to section 3 of Amazons Business Solutions Agreement.
We found that your account is related to an account that may not be used to sell on our site. As a result, you may no longer sell on Amazon.com.
Actions taken:
Appealed right away explaining the situation and that Ive already been verified and validated for another marketplace so there is no valid reason for being verified twice.
Provided the bank statements and passport for Appeal 2 however was still not sufficient.
And got the following message:
Why is this happening?
We need additional documentation to verify your identity. If you currently sell on Amazon , we need to verify a change to your payment methods. If you did not make this change, contact Seller Support.
How do I reactivate my account?
Please provide the following documents and confirm that there is a valid credit card on file:
 A bill that is dated within the last 90 days for piped or natural gas, electricity, piped water, or internet service with name and address visible
 Business license, if applicable.
The name and address on the document must match your name and address in Seller Central.
Since I am not the direct owner of the property utility bills are not under my name so would be impossible for me to provide any of these docs. But for my 3rd Appeal Ive uploaded the most recent Bank Account Statement along with my Mobile Phone Contract which displays a monthly valid charge (March 2020). But lounfortunately was still not sufficient. All documents match my name and address letter by letter with the one in Seller Central.
Finally managed to get through someone over the phone and explained the current situation and while was he was understandable advised me to appeal via the account that was open by mistaken as that 's the one triggering the suspension.
Further Steps
Now I am looking to appeal again and explain the situation, however I am facing again the same request: Utility Bill dated within the last 90 days. Which for obvious reason I wont be able to get it. On top of that the account contains my bank details from my personal Amz account. However all the docs provided plus the business address in Seller Central match my name and address letter by letter.
What started as a silly mistake of registering with the wrong account for NA has now grown into a big bump that is giving me a lot headaches.
I would appreciate if any of you in here that has been through this stressful situation can share some ideas/suggestion on how I can fix these issues and reinstate my linked account.
PS: Since a Business license (if applicable) is accepted are they considering a Trademark or Sole Trader Certificate (same name/address) viable?

1660,Near identical orders Need POA for Seller Performances,"I have lost my premium shipping, because my metrics have fallen. Now I am required to submit a POA. This has happened because a customer put me a position that I had to pick the lesser of two evils. There is no real fix for this problem, should it happen in the future, but Im guessing that if it does, I should probably just take the financial hit - please let me know your opinion on how to handle it and what kind of POA I should put into place.
Please note that my items a CUSTOM, so returns, even if unused, cannot be reused and cost me.
So, a lady places an order on Amazon and cancels it. She then orders the identical item, with an ever so slight variation, on Wayfair and cancels it. Reorders on Amazon and then returns to Wayfair and reorders again. She then proceeds to reorder two more times on Amazon. In short, we have received SIX orders from the same person with the same personalization. She cancelled two and had four open. All of her orders are either exactly the same or have a tiny variation, like best manicurist or #1 manicurist.
I finally reach the lady in the eleventh hour, and she tells me she only wants one. I asked her to put a cancellation request in for all but one of the open orders, (she eventually put in a request for one after the fact).
It got late enough in the day that I had to ship, so I shipped one and cancelled the others. After this is when I received the one cancellation. The cancellations caused my metrics to plummet, and now I have to submit a POA.
My only other option here was to ship all of them items, and then get stuck refunding what she didnt want. Doing this would affect my metrics by way of defective orders.
Hope you can offer some suggestions or remedies that I am missing, along with advice on the POA.",Account Health
1661,"Invalid A-to-Z claim, granted, appeal denied. Whats next?","Customer ordered our product as a gift - Order A. Order A was fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) and was lost. After reaching us out, we suggested the customer to place second order for the same item and we will ship it ourselves to make sure it gets on time. And for order A - ask amazon to refund for the lost item.
Customer places new order B for the same item fullfilled by us (FBM). We ship it and customer receives it on time - he tells us about it via Amazons messaging system and thanks us for saving his day.
Few weeks later Amazon shows A-to-Z claim opened against order B (the one that we were able to deliver on time, not the one Amazon lost). We appealed and showed tracking number and told Amazon that customer confirmed that order is received, yet our appeal was denied. Several cases were returned with We stand by our decision.
Whats is next? It is (a) unfair, and (b) goes against our (top notch) performance. We saved customers day making it more likely for Amazon to sell to this customer again in the future, yet we got penalized for the order that Amazon screwed up. Now we have no option to appeal.

I proceeded to make a second account as instructed and added a credit card and all the required details + documents and things seemed to be OK.

I have read the previous threads by Oneida which advised me to send an email to account-confirmation and seller performance which I have done.

1663,"Pls Help: 4 Years Account Suspended, during Correction of Duplicate ASINs in CA","@Cassie_Amazon @Andre_Amazon @Oneida_Books @bunga_bunga @otherseller
We start selling on Amazon since 2016. Without knowing AINSs are shared internationally, in the early days, we wrongly created new ASINs in CA while they already exist in US. All ASINs are our own brand. Recently, during the correction process, our CA account has been suspended for misused ASIN variations. After 2 submissions, we spent another week to study the policies and cases in this forum. We understand that there are no many chances left. Before our 3rd submission, we hope to get a bit of help from here. Your time is highly appreciated in advance.
Listed are the previous notifications and submissions:
Policy Warning










Account Deactivation














POA 1st Submission


POA 2nd Submission












Amazons Response to POA




Last Policy Warning

Last Policy Warning was received after the account suspension. There are no duplicate variations in this family. Some child ASINs are out of stock for more than 1 year. We see the trend of this type of design gets popular again, so we created some new child-variations with those old ASINs and plan to send some more inventory to FBA. We checked the Variation Policy and really not sure if this violates the policy. Should we mention this issue in our POA? If so, which part of the policy it violates? We worried about blurring the issue and cause POA to be too long. Below is our draft for 3rd submission:
Dear Seller Performance Team,
We appreciate the opportunity to resubmit the appeal concerning our suspension regards misused ASIN variations. We have taken this chance better understand the policies and refine our procedures of listings creation.
A) Root causes of the Variation Policy violation
After a full investigation we found issues below:
We wrongly listed products with new ASINs in CA while the same products already exist in the US. It causes confusion to customers while they search for products.
We incorrectly having duplicate child-ASINs created in one family. It brings poor experience to customers when comparing variations.
We overlooked multiple performance notifications regards violation of variation policy.
Here are the reasons why the above issues happened:
In the US, one product is firstly created with ASIN A.
In CA, the same product is wrongly created with ASIN B. We did not know that the same product catalog is shared internationally. As a result, duplicates are created, it is prohibited by ASIN Creation Policy.
After realizing the incorrect creation of B, we created A in CA to match the existing ASIN in the US.
In CA, both A and B are created in one family. The original plan was to have B deleted after the inventory is sold out. However, this caused duplicate child variations, which violates the Variation Policy. We should have B deleted first before the creation of A.
To summarise, in the first place, only A should be created in CA to match existing ASIN in the US. So there is no duplicate ASINs or duplicate variations afterward.
B) Actions we have taken to resolve problems
We carefully read all related performance notifications regards misused variation and understand the issues.
We carefully trained our team with related policies and articles in Help section:
ASIN Creation Policy (ASIN Creation Limit, Variation Policy, Duplicate ASIN Creation Policy)
Variation Relationships Overview
Variation Relationship FAQ
We have reviewed all listings and deleted duplicate or improper variations.
C) Steps we have taken to prevent problems
ASIN Creation Policy is read and bookmarked. It will be used as a guide prior to adding new listings.
Prior to creating new listings, the product will be searched and checked if it exists in Amazons catalog.
Our variation creation procedure is changed. After the listing template files created by our assistant, the store manager needs to double-check the templates before uploading.
The points above are all included in our company policy as part of the training for new employees.
Amazons Seller Central App is downloaded on our mobile. We will monitor any notifications and act immediately.
EXAMPLE:
When we create new listings for products, we will follow the steps below.
Search in Add a Product tool, and see if products already exist in the Amazon catalog.
If yes, we will match it to the existing ASINs.
If no, we create new ASINs in Step 2.
Check if the products should be part of an existing product family, and only varies in some specific ways, for example, by size or by color.
If no, we will create a standalone product for one product, or a new family with a proper variation theme for more than one product.
If yes, move to Step 3.
Ensure the new child-variations are not duplicates of any existing ones in the family. Create a product inventory file for the store manager to check.
The store manager goes through step 1 2 3 again and double-checks the file. Then the manager uploads the Inventory File.
We apologize for not giving much importance to Performance Notifications and keep creating misused variations. We request Amazon to please consider reinstating our CA seller account. Please let us know if you believe any specific part is missing or unclear.",Account Health
1664,Suspended by amazon for Variation Abuse. Could you please give some suggestion of my POA? Thanks!,"Hello,
My account suspended by amazon for Variation Abuse, i have send POA many a time, but still not working. Could you please give me some advice of the POA or some idea for what to do?
Here is the plan of action(the last which i modify):
Dear Amazon,
Greeting from xxx!
We have received your notification about that our selling privilege was removed due to potential incorrect variants. Parent ASIN: xxx, Abusive Child ASIN: xxx.
Policy violation: Variation Abuse
Due to the companys poor supervision, errors of Variation Abuse occurred. Immediately reviewed all listing template, check the product weight detail of FBA. Before shipping, I was on vacation and did not confirm at the warehouse site whether the label corresponds to the product. After check the warehouse keepers work video, it was found that the warehouse keeper had paste wrong product(ASIN:xxx) label, the right product is xx. This led me to mistakenly think that Asin xxx and xxx with the same attributes, to get more reviews and give customers more color choices, then added the wrong child product, selected the wrong color, and created a variant relationship. Before the problem occurred, I was not completely with grasping the Amazon variant rules. Just know that the child products could be displayed on the same page after the merger, and reviews could be togerther shared.
Recognize the seriousness of the problem, immediately remove parent Asin xxx, release the variant relationship child Asin xxx and xxx, then discard the wrong product Asin xxx from FBA inventory, and also remover child Asin xxx. At the same time, our sales manager closed all listing and checked all our listing one by one, make sure every listing complies with ASIN creation policy(https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G201844590), Variation Relationships Overview(https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G8831). Any listing which has been violated the rules of Amazon has been removed.
The steps taken to prevent the misuse of variations going forward:
About listing operations for new colleagues, assigning a sub account, Sub-account permissions operation only create independent listing, modify the price, upload pictures and create FBA shipments. No longer create any variant relationships.
We have built up a Product Listing Team, let salesman, warehouse keeper, art design, Product developers discuss the attributes of the product together. After confirming that the product attributes are accurate, sign and archive according to the file format, and confirm the responsibility.
Our sales manager supervises listing according to signed files, check all listing every 3 hours for a double check to be sure no ASIN violates any rules of Amazon. Every day need to check the listing for details, reviews and feedback. Once found customer complaint, we will immediately check the content of the complaint, and modify the negative impact of product details within 6 hours. If cant solve, we will close the listing until we find a solution to modify it.
From now, four of us will relearn all the content and videos in Amazon policy, such as Variation Relationships Overview / About parent-child relationships / Create Parent-Child Relationships ""VariationTheme Create and manage listings Start Listing Your Products Now ASIN creation policy etc. Each one must to keep in mind to ensure we create the listing correctly. And every Friday afternoon, Amazon policy tests will be conducted, and those who fail the test will no longer hold any positions. We ensure that similar problems never happen again.
From now, the perimeter of our computer display is full of post-it notes. The content of the post-it notes that it is not allowed to create any variant relationship of the product, any questions immediately contact the seller support, about Amazons policies, etc. Keep these things in mind at all times. Attach please check the picture.

1665,Amazon suspended my account due to their own system problem!,"Last week, I originally want to list a trademark that has not been registered in the USPTO, but it was unsuccessful and shows that I couldnt create a product with the brand that was not registered in my account.
I was confused at first because the system kept showing that I couldnt create a listing and then my friend tolds me to try N/A, I submitted the brand name as N/A, which shows that I successfully created the product finaly. So the final product should be branded as N/A!!! Because I did not successfully create listing before. I always think so too!
The problem is coming. Yesterday I received an email telling me that my seller s account was frozen.
Because I am suspected of selling counterfeit products, this brand is not my registered brand, so needs me to submit some information and the most important brand authorization. Oh my goodness, I just check the listing on the Amazon mall interface. I realized that the sales link in the previous paragraph has always been the brand that I submitted unsuccessfully!!!
The thing is, this brand did not have any documents in the Trademark Office at all. No one has registered it!! (Ive check this , so that I originally intended to use and register this trademark this year)
I dont know why!! I paid for this Amazons system errors!! Now my account has been suspended. According to the consistent standards of Amazons support, if they cant see all the documents required in the list, including the authorization, I cant appeal successfully! But damn, I cant provide them at all, no one can provide them!!

Now, every morning when I wake up and I get any email from Amazon, my heart races. You try to do the right thing and in an instance it can all be taken away. Im thankful that Amazon realized that it was wrong to restrict my particular product in the first place, but their reasoning wasnt even close to being authentic.

latest poa(hidden some details for privacy):
Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team,
Thank you for providing me the opportunity to appeal ,my seller accounts suspension due to copyright infringement complaints.
My name is _____________. I understand that amazon takes complaints about copyright infringement of rights owners or brands very seriously and i would like to share with you my plan of action in which i explain what i have done to resolve the issue and what will i do to prevent similar complaints in the future. I have included ALL evidence of our purchases as an attachment in this email, that I have and I DO NOT plan on listing, relisting, or continuing to sell ASINs -----------and ----------. We DO NOT have permission from the rights owners to sell these products.
A request to retract their complaint has been sent to e-mails __________________ also known as ______________and/or ______________on 8/7/2019 . The Rights owner replied via email asking us to sign a non-compete contract agreement as well as notarize it so they can send a Retraction letter to Amazon. The rights owner has replied via email confirming that they have sent a retraction notice for the infringement to amazon . The confirmation from the Rights owner is attached and the Amazon case number for the retraction is 6368374131
Attached are the emails between the rights owner of the brand and us confirming the steps we have taken to prevent infringement going forward. The emails clearly show our intentions as well as the rights owner to retract the infringement notice. Attached is also the non-compete contract agreement signed by me , the owner of the company as well as legally notarized.
The root causes of the infringement:
We do not have permission to sell under the trademark ______________.
Our product looked identical as the one in the ASINs ______________ and ______________ , we just did not have the rights owner branding or name brand.
We received 2 trademark infringement complaints from the rights owners ______________ also known as ______________ for ASINs ______________ and ______________ .
Our Seller metrics received 2 Received Intellectual Property Complaints.
We sold a product that did not match the exact name brand of the listings ASINs ______________ and ______________
We were infringing on other sellers intellectual property. I take full responsibility for our actions.
We were not sourcing from the owner of the rights or an authorized seller for the products.
We did not have the right to use the copyrighted phrase _____________ or rights to list products under ASINs ______________ and ______________
To prevent infringement going forward:
The Rights owner has requested us to sign a non-compete contract agreement that will prevent us from listing any of his brand items in the future.
A non-compete contract agreement has been signed and notarized guaranteeing that we will not engage in competing with the rights owner of the brand that includes listing items withing the listings bearing the __________________trademarked logo or name in Amazon or any other marketplace.
Before listing any new products for sale on Amazon, i will verify that the products or listings do not violate any intellectual property, copyright, patent or trademark.
We have trained all managers, employees, and packers to identify potential issues in regards to copyright infringement in our inventory by checking packaging and suppliers for signs of intellectual property infringement which includes checking the United States Patent and Trademark Office for Listing in our Amazon stores.
If we are unsure of anything, we will refer to a copyright lawyer or our account manager for guidance BEFORE submitting a listing or product for FBA.
We will contact the brand owner or rights owner again for them to submit retraction notice of the infringement.
I will constantly update our knowledge on Amazon selling guidelines and policies to prevent any violations of any rules in the future.
Be proactive about our Seller metrics and monitor them constantly to make they are on target with Amazon guidelines.
I believe that this plan sufficiently addresses the issue with additional documents INCLUDING COMMUNICATION WITH THE RIGHTS OWNER that were not previously supplied and hope we can come to a mutually beneficial understanding and have our account reinstated.

1672,Amazon Fair Market Pricing Policy - Transferred Than New Case ID Created For Violation with Same ASINS,"Good Morning everyone,
We attached our response below and if anyone has recommendations or suggestions. Would be very appreciated.
This is our response to
Notice one:
Date of Notice: 13-Apr-20
ASIN: B001AZFA0O
Policy Violation: Violation of Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy
Notice two:
Date of Notice: 10-Apr-20
ASIN: B008I7TNDW
Policy Violation: Violation of Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy
Notice three:
Date of Notice: 9-Apr-20
ASIN: B076VWF5Q1
Policy Violation: Violation of Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy
Thanks for speaking with me regarding my Amazon Selling Account
 The root cause(s) of why the violation happened.
After understanding more and familiarizing with the policys set in place, there are several root causes which led to this violations. The main root cause for my Amazon Fair Market Pricing Violation is we could not compete with online pricing. We could not compete with shipping rates, the cost of supply was high, pickup/freight charges were incurred. We supplied invoices for knowledge and for better understanding. Furthermore, we did no prior research for the history of the product or suggested retail price. We structured our pricing for the ASINS as if it was a vacuum product. We realize with this being said, we did not take into consideration the market value of the product and understand what triggered a red flag to Amazon. A root cause that I found is we piggie backed onto an existing listing and used our same shipping template we typically would use for vacuum products. This led to higher shipping costs that were factored into the price of toilet paper. All shipping was purchased through buy shipping on orders and ranged from $45-95. Prior to violation, we have not done research on products or appealed since the creation of our account last year in March. We have always worked on structuring our pricing to always be competitive with the lowest price and buy box. Not to mention, we recently started doing FBA one month prior to shutdown and have been dominating buy box and lowest pricing. Since listing creations for FBA, we have not increased but decreased pricing prior to risk or first violation. Although, we have the opportunity to charge more for our products we choose not too. Furthermore, we are paying more to fulfill with less profit margins and have the capabilities to FBM. However, Amazon was kind enough to assist a representative who was excellent actually exceptional in guiding me and led me to invest and expand into a completely different market. With this kind decision, we have invested in our first order over $10,000 just to test the waters and have hired a new employee for the sole basis that we want to do FBA at a very higher volume and expand to many different categories we can beat pricing in. The main root cause of violation for the ASINS listed above are solely our fault for not monitoring pricing history and researching product on the market. We structure our pricing based off of the costs incurred by distributor. The inability to dropship since the supplier has reverted to a non/cancellable policy put us in a position where we had to charge more for the items. We supplied invoices for knowledge and for better understanding.
 The actions you have taken to resolve violation.
I have implemented a daily task of checking account dashboard for any violations not just for fair pricing policy but any violation in general. We realize that we did not take the necessary steps at first to resolve the appeal at the time which is unacceptable. This is necessary and decided this is a great way to fix any violations day by day. We wanted to apologize for the inconvenience of missing your call. I believe if we would have sent an appeal or explained prior to risk of deactivation that this would have been avoided. We have removed listings we believe can be interpreted as pricing issue. Each product will be checked across 2 other major platforms to offer best pricing available. If not, we contact seller support before posting as we do not want to run the risk of deactivation.The actions took prior to violations after multiple trys and contacting amazon seller support with case id (6923138921), they suggested to create a new listings and use the same UPC code and that my maximum pricing was creating an issue. I went ahead and created a new listing with pictures from Clorox manufacturer of photos, descriptions, vital info, etc. After checking on the listing again, the UPC code or listing did not change and merged into the same product ASIN/UPC. On April 1, 2020, a customer on the listing asked if the machine or solution is for sale, I responded that this is the complete unit for sale, which can still be found if you look at questions about product. Since then, I have contacted the distributor and requested new UPC code to create a new listing. I have refrained from selling the ASIN and going forward, will refrain from using someone elses listing and try to create an entire new listing. I will ask for approval from amazon at a later date. As of today, we have so far repriced almost 30% of our total catalog and created a strategy to reprice everything according to MSRP or retail suggested price. In addition, we are working on complete the last 40-50% of our automated pricing in order for amazon to be informed what our minimum/maximum price is at all times. We also wanted to mention that as of March 1,2020-present. We have been at constantly monitoring 60-70% lowest price on our products. We have implemented a new strategy to combat the pricing violation and me and my employees have each spent our time understanding the new policy in place. I went ahead and created a new listing with pictures from Clorox manufacturer of photos, descriptions, vital info, etc. I removed all paper products from inventory to prevent future violations.
The steps you have taken to prevent violation going forward
Moving forward to adhere to policy and future violations if reinstated, I have implemented a daily task of checking account dashboard for any violations not just for fair pricing policy but any violation in general. We realize that we did not appeal at the time or in the past and this necessary and decided this is a great way to find a solution for any violations day by day. We wanted to apologize for the inconvenience of missing your call. I believe if we would have sent an appeal or explained prior to risk of deactivation that this would have been avoided. I have added extra steps before adding any new products. Since then, I have contacted the distributor and requested new UPC code to create a new listing. I have refrained from selling the ASIN and going forward, will refrain from using someone elses listing and try to create an entire new listing. I will ask for approval from amazon at a later date. Before creating a listing, part number must be original and detailed oriented page. Listing must include description and greater detail explained of product listed for sale. Each product will be checked across 2 other major platforms to offer best pricing available. We understand we are the ones who price our product and want to provide the best customer pricing/experience. I am in contact with UPS and FedEx rep and currently negotiating lower shipping rates as well as adding a additional signature conformation service once product received, due to prevent any missing or non-received product. I can provide reference to verify this statement is accurate. This will prevent future orders from mishandling and help give amazon customers better pricing/shopping experience. Additionally, before listing product, I will first check for MAP pricing or adhere to suggested retail price. If we are unsure about anything, we always have Amazon customer service for clarification. We really value our friendship with Amazon and hate the position we are in and hope this matter can get resolved,
Thanks for letting us Sell on Amazon,
Sincerely,",Account Health

Dear Amazon Team,
I listed the products that i was not approved to sell because I was in process of seeking a stable and trustworthy distributor. And i could not provide a proper invoice and authorization letter to sell.
I know I have made big mistake. I have cleared out my whole inventory and I will revised my inventory. I have secured a large official distributor of Korean cosmetics and will only what I already have on stock with proper invoice or authorization to sell.
My inventory will be sourced from reliable source such as directly from the manufacturers or authorized distributor who could provide me valid invoices meeting Amazon policy. And I will seek a permission from the brand owner to be able to sell their product on Amazon.
I will check carefully the product perfectly match their Amazon pages in every details. And I will follow all Amazon policies and guidelines.
Listing - I have seriously studied listings we have on Amazon. We have provided a detailed description of the product. Such as description mentioned on the product, brand, manufacturer, UPC, edition, quantity, packaging, color and instruction. I guarantee that these products our customers receive are the same as website description. And I tried the product before I sell to make sure the function is as same as the description.
Packaging -I have used high-grade bubble wrap for all items and use quality tape to make sure packages do not come apart when mailed.
Please, do not deny me the opportunity to provide a service as a seller on the Amazon platform. My goal for many years was to become an Amazon seller and be long term partner.I remain at your disposal for any further information you may require.",Account Health
1675,Temporarily deactivated Account Intellectual Property Violation,"Yikes!!! I was just temporarily deactivated from selling on Amazon because I infringed on an Intellectual Property of ASIN B0*********** < ASIN CREATED BY ME
I must contact the rights owner Alice*****@Gmail.com
This ASIN is my own Brand ASIN!!!
Im brand registered and the only seller of this ASIN (MY ASIN)
I submitted my appeal with my Trademark, Proof of Invoices, Pictures from Manufacture, Letter of Authorization from manufacture etc.
I also had Amazon Health call me and they read over my submission and he apologized that this wasnt better investigated from the beginning.
This is my only violation and I have a 0% DSR on over 2800 units sold in the last 60 Days. My account is 6 years old and did a little over a million in sales in 2019.

1677,Amazon will make us go broke PART 2 - Booksellers please read - Desperate situation,"We also have FBA inventory which will cause us thousands of dollars in fees and we are not even able to remove the inventory.
Since 2017, booksellers, who list the catalog from the biggest and most reliable books US distributor have been experiencing copyright and trademark complaints , unfairly, as we are not responsible for them.
We have been told that the issue has been escalated to the number 9 person in Amazon, and has been brought to the attention of several Amazon representatives in Amazon US and Amazon MX.
We are not the only ones facing this issue, and we are only listing authorized books. An example: authors not knowing booksellers are authorized to sell their books is only one out of hundreds of cases that booksellers are not responsible for.
Back to our situation, we have been suspended for one month already and notice-dispute always replies with an automatic email. Last year we were reinstated after a few days.
We wrote to Jeff Bezos recently and our account was reinstated, the suspension sign dissappeared, but listings did not appear, so we wrote back and opened cases and then the suspension sign appeared again and Amazon sent us text messages informing of the limitation of the account again.
Our plan of action is excellent, the AMAZON HEALTH SUPPORT team told us it was well written and complete. To be honest, they dont know what else to suggest us to write. We have everything, invoices, proofs such as letter of authorization, a solid plan for preventing new claims, actions taken include that most claimers removed the complaintetc.
Notice-Dispute always replies the same. They even MIX the complaint IDS. Sometimes they say this ASIN belongs to this complaint ID, then they mention another complaint id. How are they going to remove the complaint if they do not have them well organized?
May we ask for any Amazon big booksellers reading this if they would be interested in sending a joint email all together to see if Amazon may take our case in consideration to fix it?
May also an Amazon representative p reading this may help us with this delicate situation? We are professional booksellers selling in the platform for over 10 years.
This is really a desperate situation as our business depends on Amazon and our income has completely stopped.

On March 29th we responded with a POA and three receipts associated with the customers orders that triggered the complaint. We now know that was a mistake and should have provided all receipts for all ASINs. The POA Submitted is as follows:
ASIN: B000Z6GS6Y  Yohji Homme by Yohji Yamamoto for Men. 3.4 Oz Eau De Toilette Spray
Complaint: Inauthentic Product
Root Cause:
-Listed this product with the UPC through Add A Product on Seller Central
-Further research revealed the product information displayed through Add a Product on Seller Central was not replicated on the actual listing of the product to the customer.
-Details on Seller Central side were an accurate representation of the product being listed.
-Details on the Customer side (Amazon.com) did not accurately represent the item.
Immediate Action: Deactivated product to avoid any further bad experiences for the customer and researched on Amazon.com (Customers Experience) this product and discovered our offer should be attached to ASIN B00P8A1Z2O
Preventative Measures: Deeper verification and research of product descriptions, images and specifications to determine the product being considered for listing is accurately represented to the customer on Amazon.com to be sure of the best customer experience. A monthly audit has been put in to place to review product descriptions, images and bullets that are being displayed to the customer and compare those to the product we have available.
ASIN: B002ANHS78  Serge Lutens Fleurs Doranger Eau De Parfum Spray for Women, 1.7 Ounce
Complaint: Inauthentic Product
Root Cause:
-Listed this product with the UPC through Add A Product on Seller Central
-Confusion created due to the number of different similar scent variations offered in this line
Immediate Action: Deactivated product to avoid any further confusion causing bad experiences for the customer
Preventative Measures: ALL listings associated with this brand (including the ASIN in question) have been deactivated as there appears to be confusion with variations (similar scents and packaging style) of this line of product. We would rather be safe than sorry and as such have removed all Serge Lutens from our product offering moving forward.
ASIN: B002AMUG7S - La Prairie Cellular Eye Contour Cream, 0.5-Ounce Box
Complaint: Inauthentic Product
Root Cause:
-Listed this product with the UPC through Add A Product on Seller Central
-Manufacturer packaging modification not represented on customer side (Amazon.com)
Immediate Action: Customer contacted to return the item 126 days after purchase. Although outside of policy, a label was provided and full refund issued. Researched the product to discover all inventory had already been sold and the item was already no longer available. We did, however, delete our offer from Amazon Seller Central to avoid any further future availability without review.
Preventative Measures: It has been brought to our attention that UPCs are recycled at times by manufacturers leaving what was once the correct product listed on Amazon to no longer be represented correctly. When the item was received back from the customer and researched, we discovered the manufacturer had modified the bottle the item was packaged in to a frosted glass vs. clear glass container. A monthly audit has been put in place to review product descriptions, images and bullets that are being displayed to the customer and compare to the product we have available.
CONCLUSION: Although there are 3 complaints out of 51 items sold of these 3 ASINs, we take customer satisfaction very seriously and all 3 ASINs have been deleted from our product offering. We understand there is always room to improve and we strive to provide the best customer experience possible. We continue to take measures to delight our customers. These three complaints are unacceptable (as we want 100% customer satisfaction) but this is in no way a reflection of our overall business practice. We believe that we now have a better understanding of the causes and have a solid plan of action in place to prevent any recurrence.

On April 17th we submitted the following appeal to Amazon:
Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team,
Thank you for the opportunity to represent our company to get our account reinstated. We value our relationship with Amazon and the customers experience through the products that we offer.
We are writing to appeal the suspension of our seller account. To begin, we understand that the primary issue for the suspension of our selling privileges was due to inauthentic product claims. We do not sell inauthentic products. Our goal is to provide a completely accurate description for all listings. It appears the process in place prior to the suspension was not completely effective. We take complete responsibility for this happening, and apologize for any unintended negative experiences these customers had. We highly value the privilege of being a seller on Amazon, and are 100% committed to ensuring that every single Amazon customer that purchases items from our storefront receives the best possible experience in accordance with their expectations.
Prior to our suspension, in the past 365 days, we have fulfilled 10,884 customer orders which represents 11,703 products for a total dollar amount sold of $XXX. For the five ASINs in question, there are a total of 106 customer orders with 116 units sold. These complaints do not represent our business practice. However, because we believe one unhappy customer is one too many, we would like to present our Plan of Action addressing this issue.
The root cause of the issue
Products were listed with the UPC through Add A Product on Seller Central. Product information displayed through Add a Product on Seller Central was not replicated on the actual listing of the product to the customer on Amazon.com. By not clicking through to do in depth research at Amazon.com directly and only using the Seller Side, the item listed was not accurately represented to the customer.
Product lines offered with a number of different similar scent variations and/or product packaging similarities without clear distinction resulted in customer confusion
Manufacturer packaging modification on a UPC not represented on the customer side (Amazon.com) and didnt realize it as we didnt go back to audit the product against the listing after it was first listed.
The actions you have taken to resolve the issue
Because we value the customers experience, after being alerted by Amazon of the complaints, we removed our offer from the Amazon listings in question to avoid any further possible bad experiences by the customers. After deactivation, we reviewed customer communication, feedback, A-Z claims and product reviews to determine the cause of the complaints and work on permanently rectifying the problem.
The steps you have taken to prevent the issue going forward
Moving forward, all employees working with our offers against Amazon listings have received modified training to complete deeper verification and research of a product by reviewing and comparing the descriptions, images and specifications. This verification will be run between our product and what is listed on Amazon.com as well as comparing what is depicted when listing a product by Add a Product on Seller Central and what details are displayed to the customer on Amazon.com. This additional cross level verification will confirm the product being considered for listing is accurately represented to the customer on Amazon.com
A regular audit has been put in place to review product descriptions, images and bullets that are being displayed to the customer and compare those to the product we have available to determine continued accuracy. If a variance of information is discovered, we will alert Amazon of the error and remove our offer from the listing until the error has been corrected in the Amazon catalog.
Through this review process, some fragrance lines have been internally flagged as having product offerings that very closely resemble one another. We have made a corporate decision that if a fragrance line has 2 or more products that have similar scents or packaging, those items will not be listed on Amazon to avoid customer confusion due to these similar variations. By removing similar variations from our offerings, we alleviate unintended customer confusion by purchasing an item that resembles what they are looking for but not actually the product they intended to purchase.
It has been brought to our attention that, at times, UPCs are recycled by manufacturers leaving what was once the correct product listed on Amazon to no longer be represented correctly. In working toward a full proof solution of catching such changes, we are working with our supplier to develop an automated solution to receive alerts when there is such change to a UPC. In the meantime, we are working with our supplier to generate weekly reports of product changes on UPCs to allow us to regularly check those UPCs and compare details to ensure accurate product representation.
As part of our ongoing effort to permanently resolve this issue, all employees involved in listing products on Amazon are now required to sign the attached Training Addendum. Moving forward, this addendum will be part of each employees performance review.
We believe that we now have a better understanding of the causes and our Plan of Action sufficiently addresses the inauthentic issue and look forward to our account being reinstated.
This afternoon, Amazon denied our appeal with the following:
Dear Holly,
We received your submission but do not have enough information to reactivate your account at this time. We cannot accept this invoice because we are unable to verify the supplier.
To reactivate your account, please send the following information:
Copies of additional invoices or receipts from your supplier issued in the last 365 days for the ASINs listed at the bottom of this email:
These documents should reflect your sales volume during the last 365 days.
Please include contact information for your supplier, including name, phone number, address, and website. We will maintain the confidentiality of your supplier contact information.
You may remove pricing information, but the rest of the document must be visible. For ease of our review, you may highlight or circle the ASIN(s) under review.
An updated plan of action that explains:
 Greater detail on the issue(s) that you believe caused the complaints about the authenticity of your items.
 Greater detail on the actions you have taken to resolve the issue(s) that caused the complaints about the authenticity of your items.
 Greater detail on the steps you have taken to prevent future complaints about the authenticity of your items.
You can only send .pdf, .jpg, .png, or .gif files. These documents must be authentic and unaltered.
How do I send the required information?
Please submit this information by replying to this email.
What happens if I do not send the requested information?

1685,200k in debt because Seller Performance wont respond. WTF!?,"Please someone at Amazon help my case.
I have been trading on Amazon for the past 8 years. I am a luxury eyewear seller. I sell branded sunglasses and accessories. I know that counterfeiting is rife on these products, which is why I do not settle for second-best sourcing. I follow the highest supply sourcing regimen from anyone else I know. If a supplier does not give me their full chain docs, Ill scrap them before we get started. Every supplier of mine is the real, official distributor. Amazon put my account under review (now suspended) six weeks ago. I sent them my invoices and a solid POA. I showed proof that there is no chance I sold anything fake. But they keep on denying my invoices, re-requesting invoices again and again. Merry-go-round style. I do not know what else I can supply Seller Performance with??. What else can I possibly submit to get my account reopened?
I feel bad for myself and for my six employees who I have had to furlough. I am doubly upset as I had to stop financially supporting my brother and his wife, who are both deaf, and unable to work. This is a devastating blow for so many, including my business which I have worked so hard to build up. I am whirlpooling into $200k debt. For what? I do not know. I would love someone to explain to me why I am still suspended.",Account Health
1686,Account Review - Please help,"Hi Everyone
First off i am on amazon.com.au and in Australia. And i need help.
On the 1st of April i received this email. I assume because i sell jigsaw puzzles. And my sales went through the roof
Hello from Amazon Selling Partner Support,
I understand you contacted us regarding the performance notification received regarding your account status.
I would like to inform you that your account is currently under review by our Seller performance team.
In order to expedite their review process, I would request you to provide the below mentioned documents
1. How long you have been in business.
2. Anticipated monthly sales on Amazon.
3. The address (URL or store address) of other stores where you sell these products.
4. Tracking information for recently shipped orders.
5. GSTIN, VAT ID, Tax ID, or Dun and Bradstreet (D-U-N-S) number.
So being a legitimate seller i did that then i received this:
_Hello , _
_ _
Your account is still under review. We ask for your patience while buyers leave feedback for you.
_ _
We will send you an email when our review is complete. Until then, we may not reply to further emails about this issue.
So my feedback is 2.7 - either late shipping (i WISH i could fix this) or we are incredible.
What can i do? Can i speak to someone?
With everything going on with COVID-19 all our stock and cash flow went into Amazon. I thought it would be the great business saver. They have 10s of thousands of dollars. With lockdown we thought yay we can keep going online.
Everything we have is being held by Amazon. I have had to let go of my staff and close my doors. I have emailed and begged and escalated - but nothing. My account has been open since 2017, but never done much.
We have lost everything. And i just would be like to pay the wages that i owe my staff. Pay the mortgage and maybe move forward. I have read about the nightmares about Amazon, but never thought it would happen to me. I am at my wits end.
Can someone please help? What can i do??
Thanks in advance - stay safe and well

1688,4 Different ASINS removal due to inautheticity in less than a week,"Do I have some reasons to worry?
Am I being targeted by someone? Or just a really strange coincidence?
Did this ever happened to anyone of you?
Needles to say that we have been selling this product long time and we are getting it directly from the manufacturer - they are authenic.
All removals and warnings about account suspensions (Which I am highly worry about now) came too fast all about the same Brand just different ASINS. I appealed for the first one that came about a week ago and the appeal was just denied this morning.
See below. Any suggestions for POA? Amazon is really asking for invoices that I have provided not sure what else is needed here - but again were highly concerned here because we think we may being attacked.
We want to start writing appeals to all 4 including the first one that just has been denied
Any suggestions would help.

1690,"Suspended, need advice and clarification","I thought this was a fair pricing issue, Im unsure now. Im a new seller so i am wondering what I am missing.
The notice said
As mentioned in an earlier notification, one or more of the product listings on your account are in violation of the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy
I had an item available for $12.99 when I first posted it. Nobody else was selling this item. I was not sure what price was acceptable. Heres my breakdown
$3.00 Item Cost
$1.00 shipping box and packaging
$4.00 shipping (estimate)
$5.43 fba fee (estimate)
$13.43 total (estimate)
I was losing money on the item. I only had 2 of them because Im a new seller I was just testing the item. Turns out to be a bad one and I will never try to sell it again. I was told to lower the price but was not given any hint as to what the expected price was. I lowered it to $9.99 and then $8.99 right afterward. Heres my breakdown.
$3.00 Item Cost
$1.00 shipping box and packaging
$4.00 shipping (estimate)
$4.20 fba fee (estimate)
$12.20 total (estimate)
I got another warning to lower the price. At this point I was curios as to how much more I should lower it. I contacted customer service and explained the situation. I broke down the cost of selling the item to customer service similar to this except I thought the shipping was a higher. I asked if they could suggest a price or let me know what it was previously priced. I was advised to appeal to the pricing team and explain the situation. I went to appeal and I dont know if I pressed the wrong button but I didnt see an option to explain my situation with my price appeal. Next thing I know Im suspended.
I have read Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy. I dont believe I violated it. The policy also states that in serious or repeated cases they will suspend or terminate seller privileges. I dont believe this is a serious or repeated case, although I do understand it and I do take it very seriously. I was trying to remedy the situation and did reach out for help and guidance. The action to suspend my account was quick as I was notified of my violation and need to change the price and suspended in the same day.
I appealed to reinstate my account. I explained the issue and the situation around it. My solution was to create a removal order as soon as the inventory was available to do so. It probably sounds stupid to pay for the item to be sent back to me since I have lost money on it already. I want something out of the deal and Im willing to pay a little bit more for it. I would not sell the item again. I will refrain from selling something that nobody else is selling at the moment, that I dont have a reference price for. I have read the policy and understand it.
I was sent an email today not reinstating my account but asking for more information
 Greater detail on the root cause(s) of the Pricing Multi-Pack Abuse .
 Greater detail on the actions you have taken to resolve the identified issues.
 Greater detail on the steps you have taken to prevent Pricing Multi-Pack Abuse issues going forward.
I am unsure of what else I can say, I dont believe I violated the policy and I was remedying the situation immediately after notice of the violation. Then I was penalized and am still unsure of the expectations of what the price should be.
Please advise on what my next steps should look like to be reinstated. Thank you in advance!",Account Health

1692,Account Deactivated.. Inventory destroyed..can not close the account and still have to pay seller account fees.. No way out,"Hi
I am a seller from Australia, I have a company and started my FBA plans in June 2019 by creating a seller account for the company and got my product listed and just before my product got into Amazon warehouses in Dallas I made a huge mistake by creating a personal (not for company) seller account but that was immidiately flagged by Amazon and got suspended but also got a suspension on my company account on 11/26//2019 which was a disaster as my items were arriving to Amazon warehouse in less than a week after that.
I used the appeal submission 3 times without understanding how precious a single appeal was! then wrote a proper action plan on 12/14/2019 but I got No response at all on all submissions
My company credit card still got charged for seller account fees I did not make a single sale and my listing was removed and had to destroy my inventory and paid for that too.
I removed credit card details from account but still got emails for paying fees and fees are added as negative balance to account.
Now I just want to close the account and make sure that I have no liabilities to amazon (yes I want amazon to be happy and let me go peacefully)
I submitted another appeal on the deactivation case (edited and short this time) and emailed disbursements appeals
I really do not know what to do to permanently close my seller account Looking for advice from the communityhow do I escalate this? is there any way to email Account Health team other than the submitting an appealand wait ?
I know I have done so many mistakes but really I just did not know enough

However when searched live on Amazon using XXXX few of our other active listings, among with around 300 of listings that belong to others brands do pop up in results. I have no idea why our products get tagged when searched with competitors brand name. Vice versa when we search using our trademarked brand, listings that belong to XXXX brand also appear.
How do we handle this infrigiment claim? Im planning to appeal, but thought should seek for some help first. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

All of our listings were removed by Amazon suddently, and there is no nofification or complaint emails. so we contacted with the seller support team to know the exactly reason of removal, they replied to us ""Kindly be informed that, our internal team has removed your listings because your products are using a brand value that is no longer permitted to be used on Amazon. Please note that removing the term ""KOKEN "" from the brand value will not reinstate your ASIN. ""
another seller support replied to us ""Upon checking your details, I noticed that you havent contributed the Product description and Bullet points for the listing as they were contributed by another seller. This is the reason why your ASIN has been restricted for the Brand VALENTINO.

1696,Product Review Manipulation - Possible Suspension,"Hello everyone,
I received an email from Amazon, which I have written down below for you guys. I have not been hit with a susepnsion, at least not yet. Also, I respondend quickly to them and have posted my response down below. Might not be the best response as I was anxious and wanted to get a response out to them quickly.
It has been a day and I have not received a response yet. To be honest, I am not 100% sure what Amazon wants me to admit to exactly. I have left my competitors reviews using my own account, which was wrong of me to do and I have told Amazon, but Im not sure if that is it because it wasnt done recently or if they want me to admit to possibly manipulating my own products reviews.
I would really appreciate any advice here. I messed up and I have learned my lesson, Id like to conitnue selling without taking any actions against TOS. I recently purchased $35,000+ worth of inventory and this could really hurt me.
None of my product reviews have been removed, if it was with regards to a particular review that they did not like then they would have removed it by now, right?
Should I reply to them and tell them everything that may have possibly triggered this or wait for their response? I am worried about adding anything sketchy to it that I may have done and making things worse.
They have not suspended me, is their response going to be a suspension? I am not sure how serious this is compared to other people I have seen who have gotten suspended right away it seems.
Seller support told me that if they do not receive the information that they are looking for within 3 days then they will deactivate my account, so Im worried if they dont replied within 3 days then what I have admitted to doing is not what they are looking for and I should follow up.
UPDATE: Amazon closed down the option of me being able to reply to the case and has posted the following message and my case is showing as Transferred instead of Pending Amazon Action: Your case has been forwarded to another Amazon team and they will contact you regarding your question.
Amazons email:
We attempted to reach you by phone to discuss the status of your Amazon selling account.
As a result of recent violations of Amazons Community Guidelines, your account will be temporarily deactivated in 72 hours if you do not send a plan of action addressing these violations.

Because you are manipulating product reviews. Amazons policy regarding Customer Reviews can be found at (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/200386250 4).
Amazons policies prohibit activities such as:
 creating, modifying, or posting reviews or community content regarding your own products or services
 creating, modifying, or posting reviews or community content regarding your competitors products or services
 offering compensation for customer reviews  offering compensation, including free or discounted products, in exchange for creating, modifying, or posting reviews or community content Violations of our policies may also violate applicable laws.
Amazon strives to maintain customer trust and provide the best possible shopping experience. As a result, we will investigate when we learn that sellers, vendors, or others have attempted to manipulate reviews.
Whats next? Please send a plan of action within 72 hours that includes:
 A detailed description with dates of all methods you used to post or obtain customer reviews that are prohibited by Amazon policies, or otherwise manipulate reviews.
 Contact information (name, email address, website, etc.) for any third parties you engaged to manipulate reviews or obtain prohibited reviews.
 Identifying information for any customer accounts you or a third party used to post prohibited reviews.
 Documentation (e.g., emails and receipts) from any such third party confirming you used their service.
 List of any prohibited reviews remaining on the Amazon site.
 Description of steps you have taken to prevent product review manipulation within your organization and how this will prevent future violations.
How do I send the required information? Submit this information at (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/cu/case-lobby).
What happens if I do not send the requested information? If we do not receive the requested information within 72 hours, your account will be temporarily deactivated.
My response:
Hello,
 A detailed description with dates of all methods you used to post or obtain customer reviews that are prohibited by Amazon policies, or otherwise manipulate reviews:
I believe the only review manipulation that I have done is with regards to  creating, modifying, or posting reviews or community content regarding your competitors products or services. If there is something else then let me know. But I have never posted reviews for my own products and have not compensated or offered compensation in exchange for reviews to customers.
Id like to start by apologizing for the actions I have taken that were against Amazons TOS. I have now fully understood them and will no longer take such actions in the future. Here is the details of the actions I took that were against TOS: I have left my competitors verified and unverified negative reviews using my own personal Amazon account. I have deleted the unverified reviews but I have the dates for them and the verified reviews here for you. I have not deleted the verified reviews yet, I have left them for you to see as evidence and will be deleting them after you respond to this case and have seen them. The dates for the unverified reviews that are now deleted by me: May 24, 2019, Aug 4, 2019, Jan 10, 2020, Jan 19, 2020. The dates for the verified reviews are: February 23, 2019, September 3, 2019, September 11, 2019, September 29, 2019. For the verified review that was left on February 23, 2019, it was actually before I began selling my product. So, at the time the review I left was not for a competitor but later began a competitor once I started selling which has caused a problem now.
 Contact information (name, email address, website, etc.) for any third parties you engaged to manipulate reviews or obtain prohibited reviews.
I did not engage with any third parties. All of the reviews that were left for my competitors were from my own Amazon account. Here is the URL link to my profile: https://www.amazon.com/xxxxxxx
 Identifying information for any customer accounts you or a third party used to post prohibited reviews.
No third parties were involved. Here is the URL link to my own account that was used: https://www.amazon.com/xxxxx
 Documentation (e.g., emails and receipts) from any such third party confirming you used their service.
There were no emails or receipts. There was no third party involved for my case.
 List of any prohibited reviews remaining on the Amazon site.
The URL to the remaining verified reviews that I had left are below, I will be deleting them after you have replied to this case and seen them:
https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/XXXX 2
https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/XXXX 2
https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/XXX 1
https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/XXXX 2
 Description of steps you have taken to prevent product review manipulation within your organization and how this will prevent future violations.
The first step I took was delete all of the unverified reviews that were left by me. I will be deleting the verified reviews that are still live after you have seen them. I have left them for you to be able to view. A major step I have taken to prevent future violations is ensuring that I do not leave reviews for any competitors or potential competitors. If I purchase a product that I may become one day a competitor with, I will not be leaving them a review. If I do ever leave a review for a product I purchase, I will take measures to ensure that they are in no way a competitor or a potential competitor. If I purchase a competitors product, I am not leaving them a review. My organization only consists of me, there are no employees to send them this message but the message is understood by me. I should note that I do not send my customers any auto-emails. I make sure that in my product insert customers are not asked to leave a manipulated review. When it comes down to my own products I have always ensured that my products reviews are honest. This was a mistake I made leaving my competitors reviews and it is not acceptable and will not be repeated.

1697,Some People Are Just Plain Mean And Cold,"I had 100% Rating as of today. I get negative feedback maybe once a year. I sell books mainly. I skim and check EVERY SINGLE page before I send it into FBA centers. That means I skim tens of thousands of pages, annually. Possibly closer to 100,000 pages.
A Buyer left a 2 feedback. I missed a mark on ONE page in a 300 page book. ONE page. and he thought I deserved a 2. He asked for a partial refund, but I gave him the full refund and said Happy Holidays!
He bought the book over a month ago. 3 Days before CHRISTMASa 2 ratingon a store that has held a 100% rating for an entire YEAR. I confirmed with him I refunded his purchase in FULL.
Not one word back.
Some people are just plain mean. Some people see feedback as power. Its so easy to hit the 2. Its so separated from them, isnt it? I dont know what makes certain people like this. Its rare, but it happens. Some people get a thrill or a satisfied feeling from dumping on others who make simple mistakes, and even try to rectify it.

1698,Fair Pricing Suspension,"I was just suspended for violating the fair pricing policy.
I have already disputed the finding.
This brings several questions.
Why dont we have a forum specific to this issue?
What happened to the kinder-gentler Amazon with the 72 hour notice to get our stuff together before suspension?
I was selling a bundled item. It consisted of these three ASIN
B00SD8IVTI
B00AO4E9L8
B07Q47SM5H
I added those three to my cart:
Price $28.27 plus $11.98 shipping.
My price for the bundle $16.49 plus $7.95 shipping. That is 39% lower!
OK, I know what you (and Amazon) will say. Fair pricing considers prices on AND OFF Amazon.
I couldnt find all the items in one place but here are the lowest prices online
Shampoo: iherb $6.53 plus $9.00 shipping
Body Wash: bonanza $10.88 plus free shipping
Body Spray: bonanza $9.89 plus $3.52 shipping
Grand total $39.82
Ahhhh, you will say, it just isnt online. What about local shopping.
You cant get it all local.
OK, Ill play that game and add similar items from target.
Total before tax $21.96
So, Im a monster and violate the fair pricing policy. You know, the policy that doesnt tell anyone what to do.
OK Amazonians, what price would you consider fair for this item?
No seriously, what price?

ASIN: B076VWF5Q1
Policy Violation: Violation of Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy
In light of COVID-19, We have experienced short term increase by our suppliers. All ASINS in violation were purchased higher than retail price. We had no prior research and lacked knowledge for ASINS history in order to realize this excessive markup. Our intention was not to price gouge, instead it was to provide a product that customers are demanding and at a cheaper price. In addition, We incurred separate freight charges for pickup of goods. Our mistakes was factoring the shipping cost of the goods into the final sale price. We did not create a separate shipping template and misinformed customers with free shipping options. These violations also originated from our mistake of not removing ASINs from our catalog completely. Instead, we depleted our inventory and did not sell any of the above ASINS in violation since. We made a mistake because we were not aware a product can receive violation if product is no longer for sale but still in catalog. We noticed this particular ASIN that resulted in our suspension and we did not remove initially because we believed we were charging a fair price for the product. On this particular ASIN, we did research only on Amazon. We seen another seller who had the listing of paper towels for (89.99+19.99 shipping). This led us to purchase the paper towels because we knew we can beat the price by almost 30%. We had them listed at 89.99 with sponsored ads included. When we reactivated the listing, it did not automatically give us another pricing error, instead the listing became active. The shipping cost on this ASIN specifically was anywhere from 30-45$. The good costed $22.50+freight for pickup. We made anywhere from 8-10$ max on each case after subtracting referral fees. I have provided invoices for all ASINS to be took into consideration.
I have looked over every single ASIN in my catalog and removed ASINs that have been added since the start of product policy violation. I will be able to successfully create shipping templates to provide exact shipping costs. I am currently working with UPS and FedEx and negotiating fixed rates with signature confirmation. I have identified all listings errors to make sure they are following suet. I have also researched across platforms of high demand supplies sold in my catalog for history products to assure for fair market pricing. Our listings are clear from pricing violations. We have contacted the distributor in regards to ASIN FQ51 to receive new UPC codes that will not interfere with existing UPCs. We repriced almost 30% of our total catalog and created a strategy to reprice everything according to MSRP. In addition, we are working to complete the last 40-50% of our automated pricing in order to be informed what our minimum/maximum price is.
The solution to never have to deal with these issues is to simply stop selling these goods. We realize in light COVID-19, the ASINS is violation are really being price gouged around the world. Our decision is to no longer carry these certain products. I have implemented a daily task of checking account/pricing dashboard for any violations in general. Pricing will be researched across other major platforms such as Ebay, Walmart, Target, Newegg to offer best pricing available. We must adhere to MSRP policies from certain distributors and will price accordingly. We cannot reasonably compete selling paper products. We understand we are the ones who price our product and want to provide the best customer pricing/experience. Before creating a listing, part number must be original and detailed oriented page. I have contacted the distributor and requested new UPC codes to create a new listing. This will prevent future orders from mishandling and help give amazon customers better pricing/shopping experience for our products.
Appeal prior to the one above.
The root cause(s) of why the violation happened
1. Following Pricing of Illegitimate Sellers (Unintentionally)
2. Short Term Increase by Supplier (Recent Invoice Included)
3. Shipping Cost Factored Into Full Price
4. Lack Of Prior Research/Knowledge for ASINS History
5. Lack of Communication
 The actions you have taken to resolve violation.
Effective immediately, I will create shipping templates to resemble costs associated with delivery for high demand supplies and continue until completion. This will be done by April 21,2020 Midnight. This will serve to better inform customers exactly what they pay for. I am in contact with Ups and FedEx representative and negotiating fixed smartpost rates with signature confirmation. I have identified all listings errors to make sure they are following suet. I have also researched across platforms of high demand supplies sold in my catalog for history products to assure for fair market pricing. Our listings are clear from pricing violations. We have contacted the distributor in regards to ASIN FQ51 to receive new UPC codes that will not interfere with existing UPC's.

In addition, we are working to complete the last 40-50% of our automated pricing in order to be informed what our minimum/maximum price is.

The steps you have taken to prevent violation going forward
I have implemented a daily task of checking account/pricing dashboard for any violations in general. Pricing will be researched across other major platforms such as Ebay, Walmart, Target, Newegg to offer best pricing available.

We understand we are the ones who price our product and want to provide the best customer pricing/experience.Before creating a listing, part number must be original and detailed oriented page. I have contacted the distributor and requested new UPC codes to create a new listing. I have refrained from selling the ASINs above and will refrain from using someone elses listing.

Thank you for always taking care of our accounts health. Also, we apologize for the confusion caused by these Intellectual Property issues.
The root cause of the issue
We have attached the Dior order invoice which was ordered for a month in March and pictures of the products that became an issue. We were placing the Dior orders through a Korean department store and only selling Dior products that were genuine. However, although we do not have the right and ownership to sell products of the Dior brand, we had taken and registered photos of products of that brand, and we were also listing items by Sell Yours for products that are already registered.
ASIN: B079SSTBN7 / B085Q3M1C2 / B085RF84GD
B085Q3M1C2 : Used Dior-owned product image.
B085RF84GD : Diors logo is included when shooting the product
B079SSTBN7 : Listed Dior product by Sell Yours without ownership
The actions we have taken to resolve the issue
New start, the safest
We removed all Dior related items from our inventory. (April 8)

We removed 1016 products from our inventory that do not have the right to sell completely. Now we have only 47 products in our inventory that hold all the documents. (April 15)

Through the Amazon Sellers Forum, we have been studying to understand the 'Intellectual Property  standard in Amazon.

The steps we have taken to prevent infringement going forward.
We follow Amazons Intellectual Property policy thoroughly (preventing same issues) and focus on 3 things to make our business successful. These are thorough pre-investigation, ownership (sales rights), monitoring and rapid response.
Thorough pre-investigation
The start of the new brand is only done through pre-investgation. Reduce unnecessary time waste and eliminate risk through thorough pre-investgation. We must solve serious problems through Koreas KOOOO and their U.S. cooperative lawyers.

I was expecting an increase in volume in December, but in one week the volume was so much that I had a day where 70 orders went out late. Im kicking myself for not adjusting my lead times prior to all this. If I had the lead times set to 3 day instead of 2 day, my rate would be fine right now.
All that said, I have submitted a plan of action and then got some edit feedback from someone at account health support. I responded with the edits but heard nothing back, and today received an email that says. We have not received a valid plan of action addressing your late shipment rate. As a result, your seller-fulfilled offers have been deactivated.

Greater detail on the actions you have taken to resolve the issue(s) that caused the complaints about the condition of your items.
Greater detail on the steps you have taken to prevent future complaints about the condition of your items.
Here are a few things to consider as you create your plan:
Sourcing: Are you sourcing the product from a trusted supplier that sells items in new condition?
Listing: Is the product accurately described on Amazon? Have you ensured that there is no ambiguity and the customer is well informed?
Packaging: Is the product in its original packaging as listed on Amazon?
Shipping: Have you taken all appropriate steps and quality checks to ensure that the product is stored, packed, and shipped appropriately, and will not be damaged when shipped?
Review your communications, reviews, and feedback from buyers to better understand the issues.

1709,Items being misclassified as medical devices,"Hello All,
Amazons bots have been on fire recently and got hit with over 300 restricted product policy violations. I opened numerous cases with seller support and the cases were transferred to the listing evaluation department and still I have no received any answer. I did get someone on the phone who advised me what is required to get these relisted. Below is their response:
""The ASINs above were removed because of the following reason This product has been identified as a prescription diagnostic or monitoring device, which is a professional-use only medical device. Per Amazon policy, professional-use only medical devices may only be sold to appropriately licensed healthcare customers who have Amazon Business accounts
Since you claim that the ASINs should not be classified as medical devices we require the following information for possible reinstatement. If you believe this determination was made in error and your product is not a professional-use only medical device, please provide (1) photos of all sides of the product packaging, (2) photos of the instructions for use included with the product, and (3) the 510(k) number issued by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for this product.""
So we have a few dilemmas:
Due to COVID-19, we have very little access to our items because our warehouse is running a skeleton crew and obtaining packing images for over 300 SKUs is near impossible to keep up with our demand in shipping.
Some of the items that they are requesting images for, all of our inventory are Amazons FBA warehouses, so we can not recall the items since Amazon is restricting removal orders.
Amazon is selling our direct competitor on the same type of item with no restrictions.
These items are oscilloscopes, and are not used in the medical field and we can not obtain a 510K form for them.
Just for clarification: These items are not medical devices at all. An oscilloscope is a laboratory instrument commonly used to display and analyze the waveform of electronic signals. In effect, the device draws a graph of the instantaneous signal voltage as a function of time. Oscilloscopes are used to view the signals coming directly from devices such as sound cards, allowing the real-time display of waves. They are used as electrocardiograms, to test circuits and to troubleshoot electronic devices such as televisions.
So we are kinda stuck between a rock and a hard place with this. Any and all help will be greatly appreciated.",Account Health

Dear Seller Performance,
Thank you for allowing me to address the issues for the below listed ASINs. I have completed an audit of my account and inventory, investigated the issues to appeal, and I would like to present my plan of action with the invoices, to resolve my business issues and continue selling on the Amazon marketplace.
Initial Complaint - Inauthentic
ASIN :
Brand :
Title :
ASIN :
Brand :
Title :
ASIN :
Brand :
Title :
Root Cause:
Products I obtained from a wholesale supply company which I have determined are unreliable and have been unable to verify the purchases. I have repeatedly been attempting to contact them and verify that the items were available and were indeed authentic. My products in warehouse have been inspected and are per the manufacturer released, unfortunately, I believe they do not fully match the UPC and ASIN which they were listed under.
Although my products were purchased from an authorized supplier, I did not research this supplier fully and ensure that the products I sourced were from a reputable supplier. Suppliers were not vetted properly.
I do not have brand authorization letters; I can only provide my receipts for proof of purchase. I verified that the retailer is an authorized distributor of the Huffy brand.
I did not regularly inspect my products to ensure authenticity, I did not do random inspections for positive customer experiences. I did not verify the authenticity of the products I sourced prior to listing them. I did not perform a quality check of these products.
I obtained order confirmations for my sourced products but did not request other documentation or invoices for additional proof of authenticity and record of transactions.
I did not store my products to help preserve the integrity of your products and their packaging, items could have endured warehouse or shipping damage. This action on my part could have cause buyers to question authenticity of the products.
What have I done to fix the current issues with ASIN in my account? :
I have removed these items from my inventory and will not list them again. I have pulled all inventory proactively from my account.
I have ceased using these wholesale suppliers and have removed all products from my inventory, warehouse and have returned these items to the supplier for reimbursement.
I have reviewed all my listings and updated all items for what I have in warehouse. I have inspected and review my products and will continue to have dedicated staff to source, sample, purchase, inspect, list, prep and sell.
I will immediately verify the items I sourced are accurately listed with proper product name and descriptions as well as verify whether the items are authentic and produced by the original manufacturer. All products will be referenced and authenticated prior to being sold on the Amazon platform. All items listed in my inventory will be verified with the manufacturers catalogue, for any issues which might cause buyer dissatisfaction, and verified as authentic, prior to listing.
I will only use trusted, vetted suppliers/manufacturers. Any item expressly not complying with Condition Guidelines, Prohibited Seller Activities and Actions, Product Detail Page Rules, Policies and Agreements or complying with the Anti-Counterfeiting Policy will not be offered in my inventory. I have investigated all my inventory and records, to verify all my inventory has a chain of custody, are authentic and genuine. I will focus on manufacturers which provide quality control checks and inspections to guarantee my products are safe, authentic, properly listed and sold for buyers satisfaction.
Suppliers determined to be unreliable or products are inspected and cannot be properly verified as authentic, I will discontinue my relationship with the offending supplier. If items do not match the corresponding ASIN or appeared different from the known authentic item, I will discontinue using the offending supplier. I will locate and verify new suppliers.
I will follow and comply with all Amazon listing standards, removing any prohibited information, including all relevant information and using product detail pages to inform buyers of product information, newer versions, safety standards, implications and cautions. List items in the correct condition, if NEW: a brand-new, unused, unopened item in its original packaging, with all original packaging materials, and original protective wrapping intact. All customer returns will be removed and inspected, as to not forward items to new buyers, this will stop these in the future.
I am working to create new standards for my company in line with Amazons high standards for all listings, products and shipments to any FBA warehouses or customers orders. I am focused on buyers messages, condition guidelines, product detail page rules and verifying all procedures are properly followed, issues which would affect my account now and in the future. I am implementing new policy and procedure in sourcing, purchasing, sorting, inspecting and listing items in my Amazon inventory.
Actions I have taken to prevent similar complaints in the future:
I have processes in place to source, order, inspect and verify all products prior to listing. I have hired new staffs and created a full employee handbook to ensure all items listed match the products I have on hand. I will not offer, sell or list items I cannot verify all chain of custody and items are exact matches to what the manufacturer releases as authentic.
I will obtain pre-approval for all brands I intend to sell, now and in the future.
I will upgrade my infrastructure and staff to provide ultimate buyer satisfaction. Staff will be educated in sourcing, purchasing, prep, shipping, tracking and customer service from reliable suppliers. I will have dedicated staff to verify purchases, listings and products prior to selling to Amazon buyers.
I will be happy to convert from Fulfilled by Merchant to Fulfilled by Amazon in the future.
Any suppliers, now and in the future, I will inspect and verify all items are authentic prior to sourcing, listing or selling these items. Any supplier who cannot provide the proper documentation, order confirmations, receipts, proper invoicing, or records of transactions, I will no longer source/purchase from this supplier and remove questionable listings and items from my inventory. I will order sample products and inspect all items for quality, authenticity and safety.
I will regularly check my Product Authenticity Customer Complaints under the Product Policy Compliance in my Account Health. I will remove items from my inventory, which cause buyer dissatisfaction or questions of authenticity. I will then determine the supplier, verify the product and show/provide to Amazon my proof of authenticity and purchase.
All listings will be updated to include new images, proper information regarding instructions, indications, warnings and directions to inform buyers, so there is no confusion and all items will be properly listed. Items with buyers feedback will be investigated and issues will be rectified prior to re-listing.
I have reviewed my business practices, staff and model completely. I have read and reread the Amazon TOS, Condition Guidelines, Amazon Anti-Counterfeiting Policy and Policies and Agreements, Prohibited Seller Activities and Actions, Product Detail Pages Rules, all buyer messages, feedback/reviews/returns and any other items pertaining to these issues in my account. I will be highly aware of all restricted brands on Amazon.
I will focus on making sure items are correctly listed and are genuine and authentic. I will keep proper chain of custody and proof of eligibility to offer these products and for me to offer them to consumers. I am approaching this from several angles, by regularly checking and requiring proof from the supplier to make sure there is no degradation in the supply chain.
All products will be following condition guidelines and the product detail page rules, to offer the ultimate buyer satisfaction. All items will be from authorized distributors and be manufactured by the original manufacturer, with no wear or damage, no dirt or other issues.
Products will be properly prepped, including boxes or polybags, protective seals, exterior wrapping, tags and all items remain authentic and in pristine condition for buyers.
Review and update listings monthly, to ensure exact matches with product detail pages, ensuring ASIN updates have not caused items I am selling to be mismatched from the detail page, descriptions, images or listing title. Remove all products from my inventory with aged, expired products, lot numbers not verified and unidentified date of manufacture, for quality control.
Resolve all buyers issues quickly and courteously, answering all buyers messages within 24 hours. Accept all returns, refund when necessary, resolve all complaints, read through all feedback and reviews to make sure the products are new, correct size, color and function; not damaged or in used condition; including warehouse damage or wear from returns.
Act in a manner that ensures a trustworthy experience for Amazon customers, in accordance with Amazon TOS and policies, as well as any local, State and Federal laws.
I have thoroughly gone over my account to ensure my products are authentic. I believe I am in full compliance with Amazon TOS, Policy and Agreements, Anti-Counterfeiting Policy, Product Detail Page Rules and the Condition guidelines. All these complaints were not caused by factors out of my control or anti-competitive behavior. I use Amazons drop shipping protocol and do not violate any of the policies regarding this.
I were diligently focused on my business, but were ignorant of my account issues, and lack of sourcing items in a timely manner, this caused my current situation and I have implemented a new policy and procedures for my selling account.
I have educated myself to ensure my full compliance. Please find my receipts, images of my products and full supplier information attached.
I look forward to your review and favorable decision, allowing me to continue selling on the Amazon platform.
Thank you

1715,Is Amazon Broken? No High Priced Errors? Instant Suspension?,"I want to discuss the Issue not a quick response of sell another product, that does not address the issue.
When a platform approves sellers to list a product and then Blocks it with no opportunity of correcting it and now is at risk of a possible suspension or deactivation, for listing a product that violates the Fair Market Pricing which gives you no guidance, is just crazy.
The old system of High Priced Errors worked well. The system did not like your price, it did not get listed. No harm, No foul. Find the ceiling where you could list at and then make the decision of whether to buy more or not.
Now the system allows you to set a trap for yourself. We are literally listing products that we are losing money on and getting blocked. None of this makes sense anymore?
As third party sellers, we have multiple layers of costs and can not compete when megastores who can buy the products we sell for 1/3 of what we can. That is why 90% of all small local town stores closed and could this be happening to 3rd party sellers like us?
How is Amazon putting blame on us when selling a product that we have to pay 2 to 3 times more for to sell and then layering Amazon Fees on top of it and then we have to offer free shipping, again raising the price?
They have to fix the High Price Error and stop hurting good sellers that have invested their life savings to help support and provide for their families from the largest selling platform in the world.

I respond the moment I received the A to Z claim with the tracking and delivery information along with the buyers communication that she did receive the item
April 15th Amazon rules in buyers favor and credits her account $32.53
The ruling:
We have granted an A-to-z Guarantee claim of $32.53 on order 113-7621273-0488252. We have debited the amount from your account and have counted the claim against your Order Defect Rate.
Why is this happening?
The A-to-z Guarantee protects customers when they purchase items sold and fulfilled by you directly. Our guarantee covers both the timely delivery and the condition of items you sell. If customers are unsatisfied with either and cannot reach a resolution with you, we enable them to file a claim with us. In this case, the customer claimed an issue with delivery and the tracking information you provided was either insufficient or the order was not actually received by the customer.
April 15th I appeal the decision stating the facts again - shipping was purchased through Amazon, delivered within time-frame and that buyer stated in messages that she had received the item
April 18th Amazon denies my appeal
The ruling:
Thank you for taking the time to provide us with additional information regarding the claim on order ***. Upon further review, we have decided to uphold our original decision.
Why was my appeal denied?
You are responsible for the claim because we did not receive the specific information we requested on 04/11/2020. (I responded when the claim was opened on 04/09/20) When a buyer files a claim on one of your orders, we send an email to let you know about the claim and how to respond. During our review of the claim, we may ask you to provide more information. If you do not respond to us within the specified timeframe, we will grant the buyers claim and the claim amount will be debited from your account.
You can contact the buyer to make return arrangements, but please keep in mind that they are not obliged to return the item. They may be willing to do so if you provide a pre-paid return label, organize a collection, or issue a refund for the return costs.

Good Afternoon AMAZON Seller Performance Team
Thanks for received our submission
We are very concern and we do not understand why? you do not have enough information
But we are open to resend the files you asked in the first place
Why do you say that may be we are offering inauthentic items?
The original support that we already attached in our last email included:
(01) one Instant Pot
(01) one The Pioneer Woman
Now you are asking about:
(01) One T-fal Simply 20 Piece Cook Set-Red
(01) One Ninja Coffee Bar
As we explained in the previous appeal the items that we offer in Amazon were bought through Walmart Liquidations Auctions hosted B-Stock Solutions.
Walmart is the initial buyer directly from the factory of each brand. We attached the manifest with each item we bought from them (In this are included the units that Amazon presume that may be are unauthentic) and as the invoice they sent to us.
We also attached originals photos of the products with barcode and details in order you can verify their authenticity.
We have been operating the account since March 23rd, 2020 and since then Amazon had not paid us for the Items that have been sold, even though we have claimed on a couple of occasions and Amazon have not been able to give us an answer and now with our blocked account the payment process will be further expanded, which is disrespectful since no customer has complained about the authenticity of the items. We appreciate that you can reactivate our account, since we have all the supports or please contact us in order to speak better about all this is happening to us we really appreciate a better explanation +17965992039

1719,Fair Pricing Policy Warning Notification from listings-evaluations,"Friends,
I got an email from listings-evaluation@amazon for a pricing violation on an ASIN that is not on my Dashboard on April 14th, 2020. It said I was in violation of the price of an item I tried to list a couple of days ago. ASIN B074QP27PL. It had the yellow circle blocking the listing so I just decided to remove it from off of my inventory (deleting it entirely) because it wasnt worth the hassle to list it. The day I got this notification April 14th, 2020 there was nothing on my dahsboard for the previously mentioned ASIN.
There have been no performance notifications sent to me via Amazon Dashboard, neither has there been a Listing Violation on my Account Health page. Is there any action I need to take? I do not want to get my account suspended. Any advice would be helpful.
By the way the item in question was a box of gloves I listed for $24.99, Walmart has them listed at $23.93, Amazon is not even selling them as their listings say unavailable. My price to list was fair for these type of gloves, Im not sure why I would get the notification from Amazon, most especially when its been deleted from my inventory prior to getting the notification from listings-evaluation.",Account Health

1724,Account Disabled Please Help,"Root Cause of the Issue:
About 4 years ago, my husband lost his job when their company shut down. As a result, we began selling merchandise on Amazon to supplement our income until he could once again be employed. The account we had was very healthy and had great ratings and was well established. When my husband became employed and it began to be too difficult to manage both his job and Amazon, we decided to deactivate our account with plans to only open it back up for holiday sales. After the account was deactivated, Amazon continued to draft our account for monthly selling fees. We tried repeatedly to get this fixed and after several months, it seemed as if someone at Amazon had finally fixed the problem and we were no longer being charged. We certainly did not know at the time that the account had been deleted. We had every intention of using the account again.
Now 4 years later, we try to login to our Seller account to reactivate it and begin selling again. However, we were not able to login. We tried clicking forgot username and password to obtain the old login information. After many attempts, we contacted Amazon for help in resolving our login issue. Each person we spoke with could never find our account. Finally on January 20, 2020, at 10:55 am (Central time) I spoke with someone at Amazon and explained the situation once again. This time, the person that I spoke with told me we would have to create another account. I did as instructed and we resumed selling on Amazon. At this point, we still had no idea our original account had been deleted. We just assumed there was an issue at Amazon. It was not until our new account was suspended that we realized there was an issue and if it were up to us, we would still be using our old account because it was well established, but now we have had to start all over again to establish another healthy account with good ratings.

1726,Notification of Restricted Products Removal,"Hello All,
I am a brand owner for a cosmetics/skin care company. I have been selling on Amazon for a little over 2 years. My best selling product is a Drying Lotion which is used to help get rid of blemishes and pimples. This morning I received an email from Amazon restricting this product because of a totally false reason, which I will copy and paste below. It states that my product has been identified as a skin lightening or brightening product which it is not and has zero keywords, descriptions or ingredients in it to be even closely associated with this. In fact Amazon used to purchase the product directly from me. Since then, I now sell this in FBA and recently FBM due to the covid 19 pandemic. I currently have over 122 pieces in the inventory and this is my flagship product. It his considered under the hazordous material which I was approved for and located at all Amazon centers that are Hazmat. I spoke to a rep over the phone and received this response so far Hello from Amazon Selling Partner Support,
Thank you for your continued patience. At this time I am working with our internal team to reach a resolution on your case. While I dont currently have an update, I will follow up with you as soon as additional information is available.
Now as you will see below Amazon would want me to provide 5 documents to to sell for skin lightening products and or brightening productsbut this is neither, it is a Drying Lotion like many other competitors are selling on Amazon and the name on the product is Bio Clean Drying Lotion. I can not afford to have any issues with this. Please advise, and thank you.

What might help too, is to find the ASIN for the individual pack and mention that ASIN in your PoA and show your price is less per unit than the single pack.

1729,Help - Suspended for engaging in price gouging in violation of the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy,"Dear All,
This is my first time posting a topic here. Please excuse me being a newbie. Working here since December 2019.
What actually happened:
I was out of stock with this item and entered 0 in inventory but still was getting order (Also faced by many other sellers) so I increased price to 50 so that i will not receive any order buyer will buy from Lowest Price obviously. I received item in stock and input 1 in inventory but omitted to recheck the price, this was the only mistake I ever did. But i never sold this item on higher price not once. Please help me out on this, any input is very much appreciated. Should I proceed with POA option or it was on Amazon end as the bug in Inventory forced me to increase the price at 1st place?
Amazon Original Suspension Notice:
We are contacting you because you have engaged in price gouging in violation of the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G5TUVJKZHUVMN77V 8). We expect sellers to treat our customers fairly and not take advantage of events like the global health crisis arising from the COVID-19 coronavirus.
As a result, your selling account has been suspended, and your listings have been removed from our site.
Please ship any open orders. If you have any funds in your account, they will be available after any amounts paid for A-to-z claims or chargebacks on your orders have been deducted. This usually takes about 90 days, but funds may be held longer.
You can see your balance and settlement information in the Payments section of Seller Central. If you have questions about those, please write to payments-funds@amazon.com.
If you would like Amazon to consider lifting this suspension, please send us a plan that explains how you will address this problem and includes the following:
 The steps you have taken to comply with the Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy on all ASINs you offer.
 The steps you will periodically take to ensure that similar issues will not repeat.
 Any additional details you would like us to know.
So I proceeded with following as reply and submitted on April 1st;
"" Dear Seller Performance Team,
Thank you for providing us with the opportunity to appeal our seller accounts suspension due to Product Gouging.
For these past days we have sent 2 messages in the same case to Seller Support Team asking for help understand the issue with our suspension so that we could better address it and also to resolve it promptly. But sadly we still havent heard from them.
We would like to come out clean as;
Firstly, we are not selling single life-saving item related to COVID-19 for which demand is higher from the consumers like sanitizers, masks etc.
Secondly, we merely increased price for items where our cost and sale price has come at almost break-even point so to safeguard our interest we only repriced some products not more than 3-5 items.
Thirdly, we increased price for actually to not get orders for that particular product.
For Nestle Pure Life Splash Variety Pack Water ASIN __________ we accept that we did increase price. But it was never for profit but due to some error/bug in Inventory screen when we have fixed Available stock as 0 we still sometimes get a confirmed order for which we are liable to fulfill the order and we incur loss to procure the item to ship. This issue is faced by many other sellers also for which we have provided Forum Posts in below links. (2 posts are a bit old but 1 falls in 2019)
We truly and honestly apologize for the mistake we did, but you can check our all orders, we did not sell this item for higher prices for profit.
This is why we increased the price so much that no one will buy this item from us and buy from seller who is at lowest price and we sold this item couple of times but NEVER had we ever sold it at a higher price.
Last Order we got for this product, pricing details are given below;
Order Number 113-8698899-6229817
Quantity 1
Our Selling Price $ 18.24
Item Price from Vendor $ 6.98
Shipping $ 6.64
Amazon Fee $ 2.74
What we got (Profit) $ 1.88
(Vendor paid invoice is also attached for this item against the most recent order 113-8698899-6229817)
Have zero inventory listed for items and still receive confirmed sales
Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns
This issue has been cropping up a bit lately and its vex-some. I will have zero inventory for an item in my list and I will still receive a confirmed order for the material. Im very circumspect about data entry and double-check before listing the items initially for the correct number in inventory. Of course as a small seller, the result is much more punitive for me than others Any ideas or explanations of this phenomena?
Selling inventory with 0 quantity?
Selling on Amazon
Im FBM / SFP. This morning I had quantity 1 of something. It sold and shipped. Quantity went to Zero. Just checked my pending orders and now there is a pending sale for this same item? This is not a product I can get quickly and will need to cancel the order. I dont understand how it is pending I have zero inventory.
Two Orders Received on products with zero inventory
Order Management, Shipping, Feedback & Returns
We have had very few pre-fulfillment cancellation in our fulfillment by merchant stock over the years. Suddenly today two orders arrive, both with NO stock on hand because the inactive said 0. We remember selling the last one of both of these items. We are very concerned about our pre-fulfillment cancellation rate. Should we delete the hundreds of inactive products that we have in our inventory to be safe? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.
As pertinent from breakdown above, we only increased price for the product which is not related to Corona Virus as Kayak maybe be used for emergency purpose in Floods etc.
We think the issue has been addressed completely and proof also provided for your kind perusal. If there is another specific product which is the reason for this suspension, we would request you to please do share details with us, so we can explain with proof the background and need for such action from our end.
We would never go against the policies of Amazon as our aim is to provide only the best product with fair price to our valued Customers. We also ensure that we will be more cautious in future and will try our best to never face this type of issues again.

1731,Account Deactivated  but WHY?,"Can anyone help me with this? My account was suspended two months ago while Amazon researched the authenticity of my merchandise. As requested, I submitted invoices and a certificate of authenticity. I also gave the name and contact information for someone at the brands sales department who could vouch for the authenticity of the supply chain.
In the two months since then, I have received bot-generated mail asking for the documents that I had already submitted. My case logs are transferred, not answered. Only once, last week, was I lucky enough to talk with someone at Amazon. He told me that a determination was made that I was selling counterfeits. I asked whether they had called the brand to verify my purchases. After a long hold, he said that he had looked at the log, and they had just called the switchboard and asked if they know me. Not surprisingly, the person who answers the phone at a multi-billion-dollar company didnt recognize my name. No effort was made to reach my contact person. Even though Amazon had a copy of the brands invoice, they never asked the brand whether that invoice number was authentic.

1735,Account Suspended upon creation - not sure if there is a way to fix it,"Hi,
Im a brand new seller that posted here about 4 months ago, having trouble creating an Amazon Account. Long story short, my account was suspended upon creation (before I even was able to list anything), and after supplying all the documents Amazon requested, they continued to give me automatic replies asking for the same documents (which I kept providing), until they they told me they would no longer respond to my submissions.
After calling Amazon Support I got a few different reps on the phone that suggested my best chance was to try making another account (unless I misinterpreted what they said), so I did. Amazon tied these accounts to the already suspended account, and suspended those as well. After reading these forums I now know that you are never supposed to do that, but I was just following the directions of what I thought I was told, and my account was already suspended anyway.
After taking a lot of deep breaths, making a soothing music playlist and taking up yoga in quarantine, Im ready for some more potential Amazon-related abuse. Does anyone have any suggestions? Maybe things have changed since the last time I tried. I dont even know where to even begin trying to sell on Amazon now, and not sure if its even possible given my current situation.

1736,Help with an infringement on trademark complaint,"My listing was deactivated after receiving a complaint for trademark infringement. I sourced the product from an authorized distributor that purchased it directly from the manufacturer, a big electronics/cell phone company.
The listing were the ASIN currently lives was created by a third party company that is an FBM on the listing. This company filed a trademark of their logo in relation to the earbud and other accessories, but it is not part of the product in any way. Here is what their trademark description says: The mark consists of a series of lines beside a smartphone displaying mechanical gears with the words company name to the right of it in a stacked arrangement.
This company is a small cell phone shop in Florida, and I believe they did this to manipulate who can sell on that listing as they can deem themselves as being the brand owners, when they really are not.

The root cause of the issue:
This issue is related to watch bands that are compatible with Apple
Watches and the use of the APPLE design patents.
I was notified that these items were removed due to improperly used Design Patents of APPLE you do not have the right to use on the product detail pages for your listings.
The actions you have taken to resolve the issue:
I immediately ceased selling these items and deleted the listings.
I always have added the appropriate Apple and Apple Watch are registered trademarks of Apple Inc. our products are made for and compatible with the Apple Watch and has not been authorized, endorsed, sponsored or otherwise approved by Apple Inc. to the product in question however I may have missed this posting on the ASINs listed. I cannot access those ASINs to confirm.
I notified the manufacturer of this and received a copy of the invoice showing there products in question.
I have deleted these items from my catalog and no longer have any in stock to sell and will not sell them going forward.
The steps you have taken to prevent the issue going forward:
I am requesting supporting documentation from manufacturers prior to placing order that these items are 3rd party accessories and that they meet the requirements listed in the Apple provided guidelines. ATTACHMENT B
I have also made my team aware of this issue and designed a script around future compatible Apple products to be sure it reads as follows:Apple and Apple Watch are registered trademarks of Apple Inc. our products are made for and compatible with the Apple Watch and has not been authorized, endorsed, sponsored or otherwise approved by Apple Inc.
The above is approved by Apple for all aftermarket items, which I see that I was selling.

Within 7 days, please reply to this email with the following:
Copies of invoices or receipts from your supplier issued in the last 365 days. These should reflect your sales volume during that time.
Contact information for your supplier, including name, phone number, address, and website.
Easy enough I thought. I provided exactly what was requested. Asked my supplier for the relevant information and sent it along with the invoices in a reply to the email. A couple of days later I received the following response:
Your Amazon Seller Account
Dear -------,
We received your submission but do not have enough information to reactivate your listings at this time. We cannot accept this invoice because we are unable to verify the supplier.
What happens now?
Your listings for the below item(s) will remain inactive. If we receive more complaints about your listings, we may deactivate your Amazon seller account.
ASIN: --------
Title: --------
Now I am completely confused on what could be wrong with the invoices, and Amazons usual generic response doesnt clarify much. The product is in a specific niche in the pet category from a fairly well established brand with brand registry on the listings, and a professional website which I sent to them in my response as well. This product has been a best seller on many of Amazons marketplaces in the USA, Canada, and Europe for years, I am one of their Amazon distributors in my country. The brands parent company/supplier is also fairly reputable, so I have no idea how they were not able to verify the supplier. The invoices I sent included all their company info, my info, and the product details on it, and quantities reflected my sales volume as well.
My supplier is located in mainland China, but their company and brands are reputable and very well known. I source directly from them and all my products are 100% authentic. They are the only factory that manufactures this product, and as far as I know no counterfeits of this product even exist.
The weird thing is, my listing is still active and I am still getting sales on this ASIN. Its also strange how they care to review only this child ASIN and neither of the other variations. Im hesitant to reply to them again to try and fully clear this up once more with new invoices, as I fear they might realize the listing is still active and deactivate it this time. As well, I dont even know what I could ask my supplier to alter in the invoices that might satisfy them this time.
Has anyone dealt with a situation like this before, or could offer some advice? Im hoping the listing doesnt become inactive in the near future but would like to be prepared in case that were to happen. Thank you.",Account Health

The new product is unsealed. This led to 4 customer complaints that the product was opened and potentially tampered with.
The actions you have taken to resolve the issue(s) that caused the complaints about the product condition or description of your items.
We have requested removal of all units of this item from FBA fulfilment centers back to our warehouse for inspection.

We will closely monitor return comments, buyer-seller messaging, recent product reviews, and CX Health of our products. If we receive multiple complaints about the condition of a product, we will temporarily remove the listing and take the necessary steps to improve the packaging and the listing.
We will make sure the condition details (unsealed, unboxed) are listed in the Title of the product and not the bullet points.
If we are unable to make the changes mentioned above, we will remove our inventory and no longer sell the product.
Here are a few things to consider as you create your plan:
Sourcing: Are you sourcing the product from a trusted supplier that sells items in condition?
Yes. Our supplier only sells items in new condition.
Listing: Is the product accurately described on Amazon? Have you ensured that there is no ambiguity and the customer is well informed?
Yes. The product is described as unboxed and unsealed in the bullet points. We have opened a case to edit the listing so this appears in the title.
Packaging: Is the product in its original manufacturer packaging as listed on Amazon?
Yes. It is common for this product to come unsealed.
Shipping: Have you taken all appropriate steps and quality checks to ensure that the product is stored, packed, and shipped appropriately, and will not be damaged when shipped?
We are in the process of removing our inventory and inspecting the product.
Review your communications, reviews, and feedback from buyers to better understand the issues.
We have reviewed all available information regarding this product and returns including but not limited to buyer-seller communications, product reviews, seller feedback, CX feedback, returns inspections, return requests.
Be as specific as possible in your plan.
Do not limit your plan to issues with specific orders.

We do not invoice ourselves for the items we manufacture and sell, so do we explain that and include the brand authorization letter instead of the invoice? Or should we make an invoice to us from us showing the item qty and 0 for price.

1754,How to find if product can be listed on Amazon?,"Hello,
How do you find out if you are authorized to list an item in Amazon ?
Even if you have category approval, how do you find out about a particular item ? Is the general rule of thumb that if the title of an item has some brand name in it, you cannot list under that ASIN ? For example XYZ Company Garlic Press is the title of a particular ASIN. Along with that there are other ASINs without the name XYZ Company but the exact same product. So you can list under the other ASINs which do not have a company or seller name in title ?. But you cannot list under XYZ Company Garlic Press. Items are identical.
Is this correct ?
Or can you email Amazon Seller support the ASIN in question and ask them if I can list under this ASIN ?
Thanks.",Account Health

I understand that if i needed a an approval, upon listing the product the platform will prompt me to do so in which my cases that did not happen and so my list was published.
Now after couple listings, i get these claims and as others on here were saying, hardly i get a proper response directing me.

1760,Question About Negative Feedback,"Hello I started selling on Amazon about a month ago and to say the least the communication from the Amazon Seller Support team has been lackluster. There have been a few questions/concerns that have popped up since I opened my account but all I am ever sent are email templates and whenever I actually get ahold of someone on the phone after calling 100 times they cannot help at all. I really would appreciate some assistance from a actual person on here who can read what the issue is and give me the best course of action on how to get this resolved.
So what happened was that I sold a phone case and the buyer bought it by mistake after already having it for 14 days. I accepted the return and had the product shipped back to me. The buyer put signature confirmation on the package and I was not present at any time the mail carrier tried to deliver and never received a slip to pickup from the post office. I also never received a tracking number for this return so it was hard to figure out what exactly was going on. Out of the middle of nowhere the customer leaves negative 1 star feedback saying I was refusing to issue him a refund and that I am not responding and that I am dishonest. The buyer did not contact me once and when I tried to contact him through messages a Amazon Customer Service Representative would respond back instead. It turns out that the customer was contacting Amazon directly so there was a communication issue. The buyer apologized and modified the feedback. The thing is though on my Public Seller Profile it is still showing 1 star feedback even though it clearly shows in the buyers profile he changed it.
Please let me know how I should proceed getting this feedback removed as Amazons automated system denies my request and I am not able to get ahold of a live person on the phone to explain the issue. I really dont think I did anything wrong here and this is greatly affecting my sales since I am FBM it is nearly impossible to get any feedback in the first place.",Account Health

Not clear reasons for suspension
Selling on Amazon
Thank you for your reply. I have emailed seller support to at least give me a clue if notes available on suspension. Lets see what comes out of this thank you for the tip. I will post my PoA here so you guys can give me some clue to improve or other things to cover etc. MY PLAN OF ACTION The root causes of the Sales Rank & Search and Browse violation: I have failed to answer customer questions properly, and I have directed them to buy from me by promising better quality of service and prod
All of a sudden I received more than 100.000 pending and later on cancelled orders in my inventory history. I tried to let amazon know months before and days after suspension. I have already let amazon know about violations that I think to be related to my suspension. please see link below.
(Please check https://pasteboard.co/IWhdkrw.jpg 3)
They said it is ok as long as you I did not. So all of a sudden one email from amazon and account is deactivated. The reason for deactivation is Suspension for Sales Rank, Search&Browse Violation.
Please correct me if I am wrong it simply says you made fake traffic, right? because I have done nothing to get my account deactivated for such reason. I was an individual seller trying to do good and upgrade to pro seller later on. I have sent my FBA boxes and everything was packaged by myself and I was so happy. NOW its been months since suspension. I know some of you guys will say you did something. All I want is help so I will accept everything.
I have read other threads for account health here in this forum and others. I have already sent them 2 appeals POA explaining how it is happened, what I have done, and how to prevent in the future. None of them worked. Some other friends here said that I have to accept this violation and not to blame anyone but myself. So, in the third one I accepted the violation because I had nothing else to do. I have read appeals about third party involved violations from forums and I had POA rewritten. I have accepted everything done by me, even though I had no idea and still do not know. I am an individual seller maybe making 200$ per month selling simple things, so how the heck am I going to hire or pay an organization to create fake traffic? I man if that is the reason.
PLEASE just help me. I am not getting any answer from seller support, there is no number to call (individual seller), I can not hire a lawyer (I am a student), my help logs gets answered status without any response. I have a little money hold in account, and havent received any payments since suspension. Yeah I know this doesnt look good at all.
If you have questions for me I will be ready to answer with honesty and all I have. I can provide screenshots, links, emails, other case logs, and my appeals. I promise I will never lie or mislead your answers. Thank you for your time",Account Health
1762,Listing deactivated for used sold as new,"I had a listing for one of my best selling products suddenly deactivated. I called Amazon seller support, and together we combed through all complaints, negative reviews, performance notifications, and returns for this ASIN. We were unable to find any evidence of this complaint, or of a return.
It is possible that this order (the source of the complaint) was sent from an Amazon fulfillment facility, which means it is also possible that this item was returned and then sent out again. I am the manufacturer, brand owner, and only seller for this item.
I drafted a plan of action based on advice from Amazon seller support that I address all potential issues from all complaints, returns, and negative reviews about that ASIN over the last 90 days. In response, I was asked for more details. To that, I responded what information would you like? As I have no knowledge of the complaint that was the basis of the deactivation or where the order was shipped from, I cannot speak to how to address the issue?
My appeal was declined and my listing remains deactivated.

Additional information
The root cause of the issue:
I take total responsibility for all violations of the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy and Amazon Price Gouging Policies and associated laws.
I have put an overemphasis on the Shipping Performance side of the endeavor with nearly none given to the priced products side and the offerings were priced at the current prevailing price on a listing or a very inflated price if no other units from other vendors were available, with no time spent on research of historical pricing. In addition I did not deal with the Amazon notifications regarding price issues in a proper or timely manner and also set my repricer software with very high pricing on the top of the range expecting there to always be lower prices to hold down the price of the unit I was selling.
The actions you have taken to resolve the issue:
I have issued 100% refunds for all sales on the ASINs B#*******R, B#*******4, and B#*******W shown in the seller dashboard under Performance > Product Policy Compliance > Listing Policy Violations.
The above cited ASINs and all other ASINs in inventory have been removed or set to 0 Available in order to conduct a complete pricing review for all products that will be re-added to inventory for sale, this will include price research with software that allows for history of pricing info going back 180 days plus from the current date. Going forward I will not price Items more than 10% over the 180 day average price or less. This data will be gained from a software tool that looks at the history of a product price. This will be done to ensure all items are in compliance with Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy and Amazon Price Gouging rules and associated laws.
The steps you have taken to prevent the issue going forward:
I have now studied and understood Amazon Selling Policies, including Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy and Amazon Price Gouging Policies and associated laws.
I now know that it is my responsibility to ensure compliance with Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy and Amazon Price Gouging Policies and associated laws.
I will review all emails, notifications, and the alike from Amazon and address all issues and changes to Amazon Policies in a timely manner.
I will never list for sale on Amazon any product that is not priced per the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy and Amazon Price Gouging Policies and associated laws I will not price a product for sale more then 10% over the 180 day average price or less. Also, when setting repricer software I will set the max price no more than 10% over the 180 day average price or less. I will check my product pricing on a weekly basis to ensure that my pricing stays in line with the pricing strategy stated above and if a product does not meet the pricing standard stated above it will not be offered any longer for sale.
I will refrain from listing any products that are in short supply during the COVID-19 current situation.
Also, Ive decided to include shipping as an added price rather than bundled with the item price. I am basing the shipping cost from historical data that Ive obtained through my shipping process although this is not mentioned in the cited POA.
First POA rejected in 12 hrs.
Second POA no response as of yet.",Account Health

Since then I have not received any single answer, I already submitted an elaborated POA, invoices and the Authorization letter from the brand owner
This is my POA
Dear Amazon,
We have been notified by Amazon that our account has been suspended due to offering items that may be inauthentic. The product mentioned is:
ASIN: B07M7XLGG1
Description of the issues that caused the suspension:
We take full responsibility for our account suspension. The items were listed in error by an ex-employee. Our mistake was not trying to sell inauthentic items, but rather an oversight in the listing of the items. We have learned many lessons from this, and only experienced members of staff are now authorized to list products for sale on Amazon to prevent any further issues in future. We understand that Amazon need to confirm that goods being offered for sale are authentic. We take this kind of complaint very seriously and we will make it a priority to ensure the items we have listed for sale are completely authentic.
We can confirm all of our items are purchased from our trusted supplier (Please see attached invoice)
Supplier Details:
XXXXXXXXXXX
XXXX Central Drive
Miami Beach, FL 33404
Office: xxxxxxxx EXT. 7416 | Cell: XXXXXXXXXXX| Fax:XXXXXXXXXXX3
Email: Jonathan@XXXXXXXXXXX.com
Web: www.XXXXXXXXXXX.com
Actions taken to resolve the issues:
To resolve any complaints that we receive, about any of the items that we have sold to our customers, we will always offer a refund or replacement item, to the customers satisfaction, this is our policy.
We have deleted the affected ASINs from our inventory.
We fully understand that we are responsible for ensuring that the products we offer for sale are legal and authorized for sale.
We have employed an experienced manager who will oversee the listing of products. All listings must be authorized by an experienced member of staff before being listed for sale on Amazon.
Actions taken to prevent similar complaints:
We only list and sell items that are purchased either directly from the manufacturers or authorized suppliers. Furthermore, we verify all suppliers authorized status with the manufacturer direct to ensure any inauthentic items do not reach our listings.
We have deleted the affected ASINs from our inventory permanently.
We will ensure that any policy notifications are dealt with as soon as they are received, to prevent any issues from escalating further.
We have rechecked our inventory to ensure the authenticity of all our listings and to ensure we have the right to sell all items. This process involved checking each items supply chain. This will prevent any inauthentic items reaching our listings and any future complaints of inauthenticity. We have also ensured we have relevant documentation for the listings.
We have provided thorough training on our new systems and Amazons policies and guidelines to ensure they are adhered to. This training will be updated regularly which will prevent any claims of in-authenticity.
When we list products for sale using an existing product detail page and ASIN, we will make sure that the product being offered is accurately described and matches the data currently visible under that ASIN including the EAN or UPC Barcode, product title, brand, manufacturer and part number.
We will not list against an ASIN that does not match our item description, condition or does not contain the relevant health and safety labeling. This will prevent inauthentic complaints and manage customers expectations.
I will personally monitor more closely any feedback/reviews that our products receive and if we receive any bad feedback or negative reviews, we will investigate this with the product and the supplier. If needed, we will remove the product to prevent further issues.
We have upgraded our packaging to ensure no boxes are damaged in transit and arrive in the same pristine condition that they are sent. We will ensure packaging is sufficient when sending items to our customers.
We fully understand that we are responsible for ensuring that the products we offer for sale are legal and authorized for sale.
In addition to the above, and to avoid generic customer complaints, I will ensure any queries are dealt with efficiently and all messages are responded to within 24 hours during working hours.

1768,Third time appealing. What you think?,"This is my third time appealing and any feedback would be great. Account was suspended for pricing policy violation for 1 ASIN that was on a repricer. Still a new seller so all help is appreciated.
Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team,
Thank you for providing me an opportunity to appeal my seller accounts listing policy violation.
THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE ISSUE
I listed ASIN B077NYSRFH at a price that was way higher than suggested manufactured price and retail price. It was also priced higher than competitors such as Walmart.com and Target.com. My item was priced between $33-39. Which is about $28 above the suggested retail price of $5.99. This is considered price-gouging which is in violation of the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy.
This listing was for 1 container instead of a multi-pack.
When listing ASIN B077NYSRF. I priced matched the lowest price which I always do when there is no Buy Box. At the time it was $33.
I did not check other competitors prices (Amazon.com, Walmart.com, etc) nor did I check the Suggested Retail price. I bypassed all of that and simply price matched and added it to my repricer tool
which aided in the price gouging violation because it kept raising the price (up to $39) whenever the other sellers raised theirs.
The Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy states Setting a price on a product or service that is significantly higher than recent prices offered on or off Amazon. and I unknowingly violated this policy. I had no idea that I was breaking any laws or policies at the time.
I;m still fairly new to this. But I was not up to speed on Amazons Marketplace Policies.
How I came up with $33 price point? i simply price matched the lowest selling price and added that ASIN to my repricer which is set to price match the lowest price.
Total cost equaled the shipping cost ~$9.00 added to Supplier Item Cost and fees ~$6.99
= ~$16.00
I account 15% of the cost of the product ($33) for the Amazon Fee
= ~$4.95
So my profit for this item was $33-$16-$4.95
= $12.05
I failed to read Amazons policy guidelines and applicable laws. I figured that I was pricing the item higher than normal by price matching other sellers but I didnt know that was going against any laws or policies.
I still take full responsibility and this has been a big learning lesson. I would like to share my plan of action, which describes how I will prevent this from happening again.
CORRECTIVE
1. I have deleted ASIN B077NYSRF from my inventory as well as all cleaning supplies, antibacterial and sanitizing products from my inventory that i was currently selling. I will no longer sell these items in the Foreseeable future until Amazon deems it OK.
2. I have carefully reviewed all Amazon policies, guidelines and help pages, especially the ones regarding the pricing practices sellers should follow on Amazons marketplace. I have understood all the requirements to maintain my seller account fully compliant and educated myself about the pricing practices the seller should be aware of.
have taken the time to read through the different policy pages on Amazon related to the current issue. Those pages are as follows:
Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy
https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html?itemID=5TUVJKZHUVMN77V 1

I have learned a great deal of information from those articles. Particularly about how to price my items.
3. I have went through all of my listings to ensure that they are priced fairly by checking suggested retail prices and online retailers such as Amazon.com for each listing.
4. I have completely revamped my repricer tools. I have switched to just using the pricing tool provided through seller central. And I checked and or made adjustments to every listing that is part of the automated pricing rule.
5. I was not properly keeping track of all receipts and invoices. I am now doing so. I have become much more organized with the time I have been suspended and have created a filing system.
6. I have also began to come up with a more structured business plan for the future of my Amazon Store. I am becoming more organized and professional all around.
PREVENTATIVE
1. I will no longer price match 3rd party sellers as a price point reference. I will be sure to check the suggested Manufactured Price/Suggested Retail Price, as well as reference other competitors and selling platforms which will include the manufacturers website, Amazon.com, Walmart.com, bestbuy.com, etc. )
I will not list my item before performing this step in the future.
EXAMPLE: Say I have an item that I paid $5 for.
The MSRP is $22.
It will cost me $9.00 to ship this item.
Amazon fee = 15% of $22.00= $3.00
$22-$5.00-$9.00-$3.00 = $5.00 in profit.
I like to price my items about 5% lower than my competitors when there is no Buy Box. So I would price this item around $21 which cuts profit a little but I get more sales faster.
When there is a buy box i still check competitors pricing to be sure that I am following Amazons Marketplace Policies. Specifically their pricing policies. Once I make sure this price is right I compete for the Buy Box (if there is one) by matching it and then adding the item to
the repricer tool in Seller Central to continue to match the buy box to a set minimum and maximum making sure the maximum is no violating any policies.
Items without a Buy Box that I add to the repricer will be set to match the lowest price to a set minimum and maximum making sure the maximum is no violating any policies.
I will regularly review the Amazon policies again and on a weekly basis to catch any of their updates and monitor changes in laws and regulations to ensure I can immediately take action and proactively remove any potentially non-compliant listings on time.
I will check the prices of my listings on a weekly basis to make sure they are in line with recent prices on Amazon and for similar products on other marketplaces.
I will continue to only use the repricer tool through seller central to prevent errors. I will check my repricer settings for all listings weekly.
I will be sure to keep better documentation of receipts and invoices as well as any other important information.
I will be sure to source from more reputable sources (I want to do more wholesale in the future)
I will have a better business structure and eventually get an LLC and deal with more wholesalers than retail stores to get better pricing and cut costs to get better profits.",Account Health
1769,Suspected IP Violation! Amazon AI faulty cause my Amazon Business Broke,"Please help on how to resolve or appeal our suspension.
We try appeal many times, but not working! Communication from Amazon appeal team so poor that we not even know how to proceed! Hard working the past 4 years to build up a business on Amazon, now we been out of business for 6 months!
1st of all, the listings that flaged by Amazon are not created by us. They were mostly created by Amazon Retail. We just added our inventory to sell on those listings.
Here is our Appeal:
Thank you for helping me to appeal my seller accounts suspension
Our account was suspended result of Amazons artificial intelligence algorithm malfunction. We are victim of Amazon IP infringement case loses to Christian Louboutin. We never sold any of the shoes that actually identify by Christian Louboutin as IP violation. The suspected IP violation items in questions are all Suspected IP violation, which were flagged by Amazon AI by mistake. Christian Louboutin trademark is for Red outer sole shoes. Amazon AI flags all colors outer sole as suspected violation! Amazon AI is color blink! We do not wish to fight with Amazon, so we simply accept Amazon AI fault by removed all in question items from out inventory. Our account get suspended because we did nothing initially because the product pages for the items in question were already removed/deleted by Amazon, so we though that was considered removed. We later found out after our account was suspended that Amazon wants us to delete the listing from our inventory. By deduct the inventory to zero or close the listing, does not count as remove. We have to 'Delete"" the items. Other sellers deleted their listing so they did not get suspended. We get suspended because we did not know the proper way to remove those items.

We have completed a throughout research on Amazon IP right policy and fully understand Amazon listing guideline on IP right. Also, understand how to handle listings in suspected violation by delete them permanently.
Below is our Plan of Action on resolving the suspected IP violation issue and plan to prevent similar issue from reoccur in the future.
The root cause of the issue:
we are not aware of the new Product Policy Compliance section in
Account Health page. Thus, we were not responding to Product Policy
Compliance notification.
We miss understood that a suspected listing in violation that link to a page not found, still need to be deleted. Closed these listing or zero the inventory is not considered as delete by Amazon.
The actions we have taken to resolve the issue:
We have carefully reviewed our entire Amazon account inventory to make sure all our listing are fully compliant with Amazon policies and deleted all the listings in violation from our store, that including all but not limit to red shoes from all brands we carry that potentially violating patent IC025 US 022 039 filed by Christian Louboutin.
We have black listed all potential patent risk items in our database so they will not be added back by mistake to Amazon in the future.
We will make sure all future new listings been carefully cross checked for IP issues before added to Amazon.
We have contacted all my suppliers to make sure they inform us of all IP related issues timely so I can remove any suspect or potential IP violation product immediately.
We will monitor the new Product Policy Compliance notice closely. Delete or fix all listings associated with the Product Policy Compliance violation.

1771,Account deactivated - Several Appeals denied,"Hey everybody,
Two weeks after starting to sell on Amazon, my Sellers Account was deactivated because I have listed three listings under the brand name Microsoft, which apparently requires approvals beforehand. As i came from selling on eBay, that is new to me and unfortunately I have not properly read Amazons policies.
I have spoken with Account Health Specialists on the phone and have formulated an Appeal form with a Plan of Action. Even though multiple Specialists have confirmed my Appeal looks good, it keeps getting rejected. I was hoping if someone can suggest any changes to be made. Very much appreciated.
"" Dear Amazon Seller Performance Team,
Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to my Seller Accounts suspension.
The root cause:
Our Seller Account was recently deactivated due to multiple listings posted under the Brand name Microsoft, which requires formal approval beforehand.
Due to our lack of knowledge, we unknowingly joined an existing listing which does not have Microsoft in the brand name, but is the same exact product, thus we have not received an alert that the product requires Approval.
We did not keep the invoices and receipts from our products, thus unable to provide proof for the authenticity of the items.
To resolve this issue:
We have removed all listings which violated Amazons policies. We will not relist said products again, unless we get the appropriate approvals.
On the 6th of April, we have reached out to the Supplier for access to all past invoices, however due to COVID-19 concerns we were unable to reach anyone. On the 7th we tried again, but to no response.
On the 7th of April, a Case was opened with Account Health Support, (6926898621) for further investigation and troubleshooting.
4 Team meetings took place in 2 days, to make sure all are well educated. Access to Seller Forums as well as Seller Central was provided to all members for learning and investigation purposes.
To ensure this doesnt happen again, we have followed the following plan of action:
We have gone through multiple Documentation and Resources provided in Seller Central to educate ourselves with Amazons policies and listing restrictions. We put our focus on Categories and products requiring approval* , Category, product, and listing restrictions * and Program Policies* as the main documentations for our learning process.
We have created our own Wikis which we follow before we take action, with detailed information and guides, explaining all of the checks we need to do before each action.
Before listing a new item, we will make sure if approvals are needed, we will receive those approvals or not list the item at all, as well as make sure the category is not restricted or requires approvals. We will go through all Seller Central resources mentioned above, and compare the Category and Item we are trying to list to the restricted Categories and Items in said Documentation.
Keep all invoices for all purchases made, as well as backing them up in the cloud.
We will contact a new Microsoft Authorized Supplier, found in Microsofts official distribution list at https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/distributors 1, while making sure all invoices are kept and saved.
We are unable to provide Invoices and Receipts for our current products because:
The purchase was made on the 17th of May, 2019.
The products were bought in a store, and not online, thus the only documents we received were paper receipts which we have not kept.
We are currently unable to reach the supplier due to the current COVID-19 situation. We have tried contacting multiple times via Email, Phone and Facebook but they are unavailable.
Going forward, we see a bright future with Amazon; we would like to utilize Amazons FBA service, to make sure our products are properly packed and shipped to customers with efficiency.
We ask of you, to take this terrible time into consideration and re-activate our Seller Account; we have invested much of our time, efforts and money. We have big plans to grow our Amazon business.
We can assure that such mistake will not occur again. """,Account Health

I already sent plan of action and documents 2 days ago. Documents are not an invoice, only receipts.
Receipts are from online store.
This is a part of my plan, below.
Greater detail on the actions you have taken to resolve.
Since the suspension, we have deleted every single one of our listings, from our Amazon marketplace.
We have written a formal apology letter to the complaint owner, explaining that we have removed the infringed products, as well as promising to never sell them again,.
We are doing a thorough review of the whole company, and every single piece of item we own will be reviewed so that we can be 100% sure we are not infringing any other intellectual property.
Greater detail on the steps you have taken to prevent infringement going forward.
First off we have paused our whole business, to ensure we dont infringe any more patents / trademarks or any other intellectual property.
We will never buy or make products that are protected in some way by a 3rd party patent or trademark and has any agreement necessary in order to sell the product
We will not list even a single item on Amazon, until we are sure we have the legal rights to sell the products.
In future we will firstly ask suppliers to send us the proper authorisations and certificates, which would grant us the power to sell products owned by them.
We have stopped working with every supplier who doesnt have legal authorisation and certificates for the products in question.
Every quarter we will review our whole inventory with our consultant, who will continuously monitor if a new patent or trademark is created for the products we sell.

My other account was suspended because of the inauthentic complaint, I was new and made a mistake.

I clicked on that option to see the requirements but I was approved right away. I now recognize that I am not allowed to list those products since I did not have the proper documentation to prove authenticity. Now I have LLC that is registered, we have a brand and website and I would like to use Amazon as a third party seller but my understanding is that I need to figured out my old suspension first.

The root cause of the issue
I understand that our performance as a seller has fallen below both Amazons and our own standards of quality. We had certain products listed that didnt meet clients expectations and we need to make sure we double check our inventory and re-arrange our inventory. I believe there are two reasons why this has happened:
I. Disorganized inventory management.
II. lost in control of product quality
The actions you have taken to resolve the issue
We are taking the following steps to improve our performance:
I. We will ship and confirm orders by the estimated ship by date.
II. We will remove products from our inventory that we had previously complains about
III. We will make sure all our products will be satisfying customers
IV We will make sure to keep an eye on our inventory and monitor and improve the quality of it
The steps you have taken to prevent the issue going forward
We are taking the following actions to prevent the issue from reoccurring in the future:
I. We will make changes in our inventory and remove products that we got complains about
II. We will always pay attention to our listing and listed products
III. We will make sure our customers satisfied and happy

1783,Product Policy Compliance,"Product Policy Compliance
Reason: Trademark Infringement
Hi All,
I have been working with Seller Support on this for about 2 months now.
Summary:
About 2 months ago, as soon as my inventory arrived, I received an email from AMZ on IP violation. Since then i have created detailed and specific (without fluff) POA 5 times.
Their initial email stated:
""We received a report from a rights owner that you are listing counterfeit products. Sellers on Amazon.com are not allowed to create listings or detail pages for counterfeit goods.
We removed the content listed at the end of this email. We may let you list this product again if we receive a retraction from the rights owner. Their contact information can be found below.
[omitted]
[email: omitted]
If the rights owner agrees to retract their complaint, they must send the retraction to us at notice-dispute@amazon.com.
My product is definitely not counterfeit and i a have tried to prove this to AMZ with pictures, artifacts etc.
Every time, i send them POA, they send me a canned response. Basically they want the invoice or the letter clearly state ""prove that your products do not infringe any intellectual property rights"". Not sure how can i possibly do that. My supplier who is supposedly a Gold Supplier refusing to write me a letter and have stopped responded to my inquiries.
I really dont know what to do. The ASIN owner (rights owner) is not going to retract the complaint and i can not get a letter from my manufacturer.
I have finally told AMZ, what are my options? And as expected they sent me a canned response  very frustrated.
Questions: what is the best course of action for me at this stage?
What will happen if i dont take any actions anymore. AMZ has a small inventory for that ASIN and they have blocked my listing but my account is still active and i can sell other products?
Are they going to eventually suspend my entire account.

1784,Also Suspended for Intellectual Property Complaint,"Hello,
Ive been selling full-time on Amazon since 2014, operating in the craft niche, and purchase all of our products from major craft distributors and manufacturers. I have never had any issues selling on Amazon, and as its my livelihood I am very risk-adverse. On 9/11/2019 we received an intellectual Notice: Policy Warning email alerting us that one of our ASINs was infringing on a trademark.
ASIN:B********Q
Infringement type: Counterfeit
Trademark asserted: [*******)
Complaint ID: *********
I immediately researched the product, looked up our source, and viewed the listing to see where the issue lay. The product I purchased was bought direct from the manufacturer. When I listed the product, I was unable to find an existing listing based upon the UPC. A search by the product name revealed several existing ASINs and I choose one from many possible matches and sent in inventory. The product is relatively generic and neither the listing photos or description, nor the item itself have any branding. However, the ASIN I listed against did have a by xyz company line underneath the title and that is the brand that filed the complaint. So the root cause of the infringment is I listed my product under an existing ASIN listing associated with a different brand and should have created a new ASIN listing.
On 10/3/2019 I received a call from Amazon Account Health letting me know that my account was under review and Id need to submit a POA within 72 hours or be suspended. I submitted the POA through Amazon Account Health who forwarded it on to Seller Performance and heard nothing until 17 days later when I received the email that my selling privledges have been removed saying that I failed to submit a valid plan of action.
The following day I revised and submitted the following POA through Amazon Account Health who forwarded it to Seller Performance. After submitting the POA, I decided to reached out to the brand holder to acknowledge the infringment, work out a resolution to never carry or misrepresent products under their brand, and ask for a retraction to be sent to Amazon. Unfortunately I have not heard back. I have also hired legal representation to reach out to the brand holder as well as to assist with writing further POAs.
ROOT CAUSE OF THE ISSUE
We listed a product on the product listing page for ASIN [REMOVED]. The product did not match the brand of the product listing page. Our action resulted in an Intellectual Property Infringement claim from the brand holder [REMOVED] as we were not authorized to sell this branded product.
The product purchased which we listed on ASIN [REMOVED] was purchased from [REMOVED] (invoice attached, pg. 3, line item description: [REMOVED]) and is not [REMOVED] brand.
We matched the product to ASIN [REMOVED] based upon the product title, photo, and physical attributes and description and failed to recognize that a brand name [REMOVED] was indicated on the product listing page. We claim full responsibility for our actions which led to this intellectual property infringement claim, and have implemented a plan of action outlined below to prevent further intellectual property infringement violations.
IMMEDIATE ACTION TAKEN
Upon being notified of the policy violation, we immediately closed and deleted the listing from our active inventory.
We reviewed our supplier of this product and identified the recent purchase history and invoice for this product and inspected our inventory and determined that our product was manufactured and packaged by [REMOVED].
We reviewed the product listing page and determined the root cause of the issue as outlined above and immediately implemented a plan of action to prevent future policy issues.
We did not contact the brand holder [REMOVED] for the product listed on ASIN [REMOVED] for a retraction as we do not plan to offer this product anymore.
IMPLEMENTED PLAN OF ACTION
We are committed to respecting the intellectual property rights of others such we have implemented the following plan of action to avoid future issues:
We will not list products that are generic and/or unable to determine if they are authentic or authorized to be sold by us.
We will ensure the authenticity of the products we offer by purchasing all inventory directly from manufacturers and authorized distributors of the brands we offer.
We will continue to work exclusively with US based manufacturers and brand authorized distributors.
Our current manufacturers and distributors are:
[CONTACT INFO FOR ALL SUPPLIERS/MANUFACTURERS WE PURCHASE FROM]
We will continuously work with our representatives at the above distributors to ensure there are no intellectual property issues with the brands we carry and list on Amazon and ensure we are authorized to sell these brands. Our distributors can provide us with details on the brands we are authorized to sell and notify of changes and restrictions on brands.
When creating new listings or adding products on existing listings we will review all product attributes (UPC/EAN, photos, brand, description) to ensure the product being offered is accurately represented and does not infringe on the intellectual property rights. If we have any doubts about a product listing, we will reach out to the Amazon Catalog team for guidance.
We have educated all employees regarding Amazons selling, intellectual property and listing requirements policies and have assigned a team member to the role of product listing compliance whose role is to review all new product listings to ensure they comply with all Amazon policies regarding selling, intellectual property and listing requirements and do not infringe on the intellectual property.
We are confident that this plan of action will ensure our current and future products are authentic and listed on Amazon are accurately and will avoid infringement of intellectual property rights.
Sincerely,

1785,Help with 3rd attempt plan of action- Price gouging violation,"Hi everyone,
Hoping someone can help me with my POA. My account was deactivated due to price gouging back in March. I have written 2 plans and need to write a 3rd one (more details needed). The item was a Scrubbing Bubbles Shower Cleaner. I priced at $12.00 with $4.99 shipping.
Here is the notice I received and my POA:
Hello, We are contacting you because you have engaged in price gouging in violation of the Amazon Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy (https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/G5TUVJKZHUVMN77V 1). We expect sellers to treat our customers fairly and not take advantage of events like the global health crisis arising from the COVID-19 coronavirus. As a result, your selling account has been suspended, and your listings have been removed from our site. Please ship any open orders. If you have any funds in your account, they will be available after any amounts paid for A-to-z claims or chargebacks on your orders have been deducted. This usually takes about 90 days, but funds may be held longer. You can see your balance and settlement information in the Payments section of Seller Central. If you have questions about those, please write to payments-funds@amazon.com. If you would like Amazon to consider lifting this suspension, please send us a plan that explains how you will address this problem and includes the following:  The steps you have taken to comply with the Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy on all ASINs you offer.  The steps you will periodically take to ensure that similar issues will not repeat.  Any additional details you would like us to know.
This was my POA:
Root cause
I engaged in price gauging by setting a price of $12.00 and shipping of $4.99 on ASIN: B016WFFGCI. I now understand that the price was significantly higher than other prices offered on Amazon, therefore violating the Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy. I set the price at $12.00 taking in consideration my cost, platform selling fees, shipping supplies and my time and effort.
At the time, I believe the price point was around $4.99 plus shipping. I honestly didnt think that pricing at $12.00 was wrong. I did not adhere to the Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy that states: Setting a price on a product or service that is significantly higher than recent prices offered on or off Amazon. This occurred because I did not have a full understanding of Amazons policies regarding Fair Pricing. I take full responsibility of my actions.
Actions to resolve the issue
I deleted the ASIN in violation and removed all restricted ASINs from my inventory.
I reviewed my active ASINs to ensure that I am not setting a price on a product that is significantly higher than recent prices offered on or off Amazon.
I also reduced the price of my active listings in order to match the lowest price and show good faith that I am not trying to take advantage of others in the midst of a global health crisis.
Steps to prevent the issue Moving forward
Going forward, when I list a new product, I will make sure to verify the recent prices on Amazon and other platforms. Once I gather this information, I will make sure to match or price below.
I have assessed each ASIN in my inventory to ensure compliance and reduced prices.
I am committed to constantly check throughout the week my inventory to ensure my prices are fair and not significantly higher than other offers.
As I keep growing my inventory, I will apply Automate Pricing rules to my listings to adjust my prices and stay fair. I am currently watching the videos related to Amazon Automate Pricing on Seller University.
I will contact Amazon Seller Central support when I am not clear on policies.
I have read the Amazon Marketplace Fair pricing Policy and watched Products requiring approval Seller performance Product authenticity and Amazon Automate Pricing to learn more about the platform and therefore prevent any issues moving forward.
I will continue to set aside 1 day a week to review and study amazons policies and updates.
Please consider reinstating my account. I accept full responsibility for my mistake.
Any help welcome! Thank you!

Until, that is, covid-19 shut down some of our warehouses when we had over 2,000 outstanding orders. Weve had to cancel most of those and others weve worked to get out, but with limited staff allowed in the warehouses its been VERY slow getting orders out. Due to these delays our feedback has been nothing but negative. Its dropped from that 98% down to 38%.
We of course took action and removed all of our seller fulfilled inventory from Amazon (basically all of our inventory was seller fulfilled). However, it was too late.
Amazon has been very understanding in regards to shipping metrics and keeping our account open. However, they havent done anything in regards to feedback and the consequences of having that take a sudden turn for the worse.
As it stands now, our Amazon account isnt eligible for buy box. We are not able to advertise any products. And on top of these feedback related restrictions, nobody should consider buying from a store with 38% recent feedback.
Has anyone had luck working with Amazon to mitigate the effects of negative feedback directly related to Covid-19 closures and delays? Does anyone have any advise on how to get this resolved?",Account Health

Once I reached out to the brand owner they retracted their complaint and the item dropped off my account health notifications and my selling privileges have been reinstated for that ASIN.
Then in the account under review process the seller performance team still suspended my account and the account health team doesnt know why as they believe everything was in order. Please help, has anyone had similar issues?!",Account Health

I submitted an IP request through BR and this is the response I get from Amazon. This should have been very easy Im the only seller of my brand, I only sell directly to the consumer on Amazon. Its made in the USA, this seller is shipped from China.
I was hoping you all had a template of wording you have created that gets things done without having to go around and around with support.
Amazon respects a manufacturers right to enter into distribution agreements for its products. However, violations of such agreements do not constitute intellectual property rights infringement. As the enforcement of these agreements is a matter between the manufacturer and the retailers, it would not be appropriate for Amazon to assist in enforcement activities.
We only process one intellectual property (IP) complaint at a time. In order to ensure quality and quick resolution of your notices, we will only process the specific complaint type you have chosen on the Report Infringement or Report a Violation forms (such as patent, trademark, or copyright). If you have additional IP concerns, please submit additional notices of infringement.
For example, selecting trademark infringement and discussing copyright issues in the submission. The notice will be processed as a trademark complaint only. To report infringement of a trademark and a copyright, separate notices must be filed.

1800,Brand Registry Feedback for Amazon,"I want to share some thoughts and if all of you sellers were to pass on these ideas to Amazon as well, maybe some changes will be implemented. Feel free to just copy and paste. If enough of us say the same thing, maybe they will listen. It will benefit all of us!
The problem:
A trademarked brand can enroll in Brand Registry. Any seller with inauthentic products (a generic tweezer being sold as a Tweezerman for example) can then jump onto that brands listing and start selling. That sellers action will now cause permanent harm to that brand because those customers will most likely post negative reviews. Those reviews are not applicable since they dont apply to the real product. A brand can get Amazon to remove that seller once they do a test purchase to prove it is not the real product. Meanwhile, that seller may get sales, which will generate negative reviews. What if that seller is shipping from China? That will take at least a month. The vicious cycle starts all over with every new seller. We all know how important reviews are and also how detrimental they can be to your sales if you get a bunch of negative ones too.
The Solution:
Whenever a brand proves that a product sold by a seller isnt authentic, then any reviews/ratings left by those customers will automatically be removed, since those reviews are not applicable to the real product. This will remove enormous amounts of pressure off of brands. Yes, the brand may lose some sales to those fake sellers while they do test buys and such, but those sellers actions will not cause the brand any harm as any reviews that come out of those sales, will be removed automatically.
The Better Solution:
It seems backward that brands have to prove that a product being sold by a seller is inauthentic vs the seller proving that they have authentic products to sell. There should be some kind of benefit for brands in Brand Registry with this. Maybe any brand enrolled in Brand Registry automatically has their listing restricted. A seller can then request permission to sell their authentic product and that request goes to the brand to approve. If the brand doesnt approve or doesnt respond, the seller can then send their appeal to Amazon with evidence of such authentic products, like invoices from Mfg, etc If Amazon approves it and the brand feels like it will be inauthentic products, the brand can request a test purchase before it goes live. Simply set it up so the brand is required to do all of the work and takes as much load off of Amazon as possible, but there is still protection for the brand, as that is good for everyone.

I have appealed, I have called, I have opened cases, and not one Amazon rep has assisted with this. I do not have, nor have I ever had, another Seller account. I have never tried to open an account either. I thought that it could be because I have rental properties, and I have an office building. I sent in first pages of leases to demonstrate that these were tenants and no one related to me, but no one answered that. I have been judicious in the amount of cases I have opened since that seemed to be an issue. I offered to close the Global accounts linked - since I opened those only since it was offered and without any great thought - and have not been able to do that. So: does anyone have guidance?

1807,Policy question on suspended listing,"Hello, if a listing (FBM) is suspended, does that mean the same product linked to a different listing (FBA) is also suspended? I have 2 listings for the same product, one FBM and one FBA.
Please understand that I am not trying to do something underhanded and circumvent policy. I had a listing for a item purchased directly from the manufacturer that had been selling FBA. Because of shipping restrictions due to covid-19, I could not replenish inventory, so I started selling it FBM.
A customer didnt receive the item - actually they just receive the outer packaging - and somehow this triggered a Used sold as New complaint. I appealed, sent in the proper documentation but to no avail. This listing, FBM, remains suspended.
Since I am not sure what it was actually suspended for  Amazon thinks it was poorly packaged? They didnt really give a good answer why my listing was suspended, and there was no indication they didnt like my invoices.
Is there any chance that the FBA listing is still active and I can sell it that way? I certainly do not wish to have my Amazon account suspended, so I would be eating several thousand dollars worth of inventory that cannot be returned.",Account Health

Here is the Appeal
The root cause of the issue
We listed some products using an ASIN meant for a pack quantity when the supplier feed detailed a larger multi-pack product which gave the impression that we were selling products at an unfair inflated price. An example of this is ASIN - B007760MGM, this is for a One Pack but from our supplier feed the product is A 6 pack. We demonstrated pictorial proof of this in the attached PDF.
We priced a multi pack product for more than the per unit than that of a single unit of the same product. An example of this is ASIN -B00CMSOTP0 from the 66 listing violations found in our Account Health Dashboard. We demonstrated pictorial proof of this in the attached PDF.
We did not adhere to Fair price policy that says: ""Selling multiple units of a product for more per unit than that of a single unit of the same product.
The ASINs in some of the supplier feeds we received were wrong and we did not do our due diligence to verify that they perfectly matched the important product details like pack quantity.
For some products that matched to the correct ASIN but had prices that were high. Those prices were only high because of the total cost of the item we get from our supplier. However, we found that we received listing violations for those listed products where our listing price and cost was significantly higher than given MSRP. An example of this is for ASIN B000089SA5: We demonstrated pictorial proof of this in the attached PDF.
We did not take the time to compare our listing price to other competitors on Amazon or other online retailers. If we did that we would have seen the large disparity in price and figured out that we were listing on the wrong Asin.
The actions you have taken to resolve the issue
We have deleted our entire inventory as of Match 15th 2020 to start from scratch and make sure everything is listed properly and verified to be correct
As of Match 15th 2020 we have implemented a new rule in our inventory management software to exclude products where the listing price and cost price is more than MSRP. Those products will have to be manually handled and decided upon as to what the final price should be.
Today we started scanning our entire inventory that was previously listed. What this will do is lets us know what the current lowest price on amazon for a particular Asin is. Once this scan is done we will then compare the lowest price to the default listing price that our system generated based on cost and then we will look out for significant prices differences. We will also use this as mean to point any ASIN mismatches in our system.
Earlier today we spoke to the Amazon Support Health Team to review the fair pricing policy to further make sure we didnt miss anything.
We have taken the time to read the and go through the fair pricing policy: located at https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html?itemID=G5TUVJKZHUVMN77V&language=en_US 6
We have immediately started pay more attention to the muli-pack items in our inventory feeds that have, case of, or pack of , x amount of count per pack or case because those type of items made up 90% of the listing violations. So earlier today we created another rule within our inventory management software that segments all products with case of, pack of, count, pack or case as string in their title and we will then manually make sure those those item have the correct ASIN that matches its pack quantity before listing.
The steps you have taken to prevent the issue going forward
We are no longer 100% be trusting ASIN information given to us by our suppliers. It was lazy of us to assume that they were all correct. If we had taken the time to verify them then we would have seen that the ASINs was meant for a 1 pack not 6 pack. Therefore, from now one we are committed to never listing without first checking for mismatches manually.
We will periodically run a weekly scan of our active inventory to look for large price disparity between our price and the lowest price of our competitors on Amazon and other major Online retailer.
We will also weekly check on our source inventory feeds that we get from our suppliers to make sure that there was not a change in the item pack specification which then affects our cost which would then change our price.
We will keep educating ourselves on a quarterly basis and stay informed with regards to Amazons selling policies and seller code of conduct, to ensure no points are forgotten because policies are subject to change, and for our marketplace at any time.
